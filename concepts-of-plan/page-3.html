<h3><b>1. Doll</b></h3>
<p>A doll is a special object. It is inanimate from a functional point of view, yet it is nevertheless endowed with the appearances of an animate being. In a way, therefore, a doll plays the role of a mediator between the realm of life (spirits) and the realm of death.</p>
<p>A doll is a piece of dead matter which is given its own spirit. The spirit lets the doll come alive as its own quasi-living thing. The act of fabricating a doll and giving it a name (identity), therefore, tears the boundary between the overworld and the underworld, giving birth to a "middle region" in which both the live and dead come together and establish a meaningful symbiosis. This place is an intersection between soul and matter.</p>
<p>Dolls can be found in a variety of forms in today's free market. A consumer good, for instance, is a doll which is imbued with the brand's spirit. Some people choose to buy goods of a specific brand because they assign metaphysical meanings to it, other than the pragmatic implication of the product's mere material composition.</p>
<p>Shopping, therefore, could be imagined as a process of furnishing one's own inventory of dolls - an intricate collection of enchanted icons, ready to connect the consumer's identity to the edge of reality where the distinction between the real and unreal blurs itself.</p>
