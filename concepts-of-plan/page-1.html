<p>This is a collection of my personal thoughts in regard to how a software product can be designed.</p>

<h3><b>1. Where to Begin</b></h3>
<p>Imagine that you are trying to design a software product. Depending on your field of interest, it could be a game, a social networking service, a chatbot, an educational platform, or something else.</p>
<p>No matter what type of product you have in mind, however, we can all agree that it ought to be something meaningful. And by "meaningful", I mean a set of qualitative measures which transcend a mere assortment of dry, mechanistic details.</p>
<p>When designing a software, it is necessary to resolve a gap between the product's end goal and its implementation details. We can surmount this difficulty via quantitative reasoning.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that we are trying to create a pet simulator (similar to Tamagotchi). What shall we do to fulfill such an objective?</p>
<p>First, we need to devise a list of meaningful pet-related experiences. In addition, we need to figure out how to translate them into computational procedures (because they must be part of a computer program).</p>
<p>We can achieve this by defining our pet simulator not in terms of vague emotional descriptions, but in terms of numerical quantities.</p>

<h3><b>2. Quantification of Meaning</b></h3>
<p>The question is, what kinds of numerical quantities do we want in our pet simulator?</p>
<p>This is where the problem of ambiguity arises. Overcoming this initial barrier is crucial for the sake of designing something meaningful.</p>
<p>To kick-start the design process, let me come up with a couple of ideas. The very first thing which crosses my mind is that the pet needs food to survive.</p>
<p>Whenever the pet eats something, its energy level increases. If it doesn't eat anything, its energy level will gradually drop.</p>
<p>What comes next? Let me guess. Note that food is not the only biological need. For example, the pet also needs to be caressed to feel that it is being loved.</p>
<p>For prototyping purposes, then, it will be sensible to add a pair of buttons to let us interact with the pet - one for feeding, and the other one for caressing. Clicking the former will increase the energy level, while clicking the latter will increase the affection level.</p>
<p>Here, we can see an example of a dilemma between two choices. While we are feeding the pet, it cannot be caressed. And while we are caressing the pet, it cannot be fed.</p>

<h3><b>3. The Geometry of Variables</b></h3>
<p>The design of a virtual pet, then, can be summarized as the following two steps:</p>
<p>(1) Create a set of variables, each of which represents a unique aspect of the pet's state.<br>(2) Create a set of actions, which either increment or decrement these variables when invoked.</p>
<p>The act of feeding, for instance, may greatly amplify the pet's energy level but slightly reduce its affection level. The act of caressing, on the other hand, may greatly amplify the pet's affection level but slightly reduce its energy level.</p>
<p>And if we spend time without doing anything, both the pet's energy and affection levels can be expected to decay as time passes by.</p>
<p>The dynamics of pet simulation can be easily visualized. For example, we can treat the pet's current state as a particle on a 2D plane, whose axes denote the pet's energy and affection levels, respectively.</p>
<p>Each action, then, will be interpreted as a force which pushes the particle in a specific direction.</p>
