<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Alien</p>
<p>(PERSONAL NOTE)</p>
<p>By the time I saw this alien creature standing in front of my HR office, I had already conducted hours of research regarding the nature of his kind. He belonged to one of the most obscure species of the IT industry, formally classified as "engineers".</p>
<p>Mr. Cavitt told me to be in charge of this first job interview, since I was the only person in the management team who was able to comprehend this creature's tech-talk.</p>
<p>The way this alien being communicated with others was so awkward, yet strangely direct and powerful whenever he was explaining to others anything computer-related!</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that I could not understand most of the technical jargons he happened to be passionate about, I have always felt that the alien did not possess even a tiny bit of social skill to let him realize that I do not care about those things. This helped me do my job as a recruiter because it allowed me to make him keep talking about his tech stuff while I was just pretending to be interested.</p>
<p>I refer to the alien as "he", but the being wasn't really sexual in any way. "He" did have a rather brute mood of masculine indifference, yet in terms of physiology, the being was nearly asexual because its reproductive organs were negligibly small (probably dysfunctional, too). This was understandable because the inability of his kind to reproduce is a core mechanism of rarity which secures the high pay range of engineers.</p>
<p>His body was more like the body of a "robot" than a human being, whose anatomical features were optimized for minimal social interactions. His head was disproportionately large and flat, while his arms/legs were so pitifully short and feeble. His eyes resembled those of classical Victorian pinhole cameras.</p>
<p>His name was "Airl", which was not really his original name but nevertheless given by me because it was easier to spell and pronounce.</p>
