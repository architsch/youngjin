"Have you done any programming in OpenGL?"

"Do you have experience with JQuery?"

"Have you shipped at least one commercial app that was made with Flutter?"

These are common types of questions which often arise during an engineer recruitment process.
Such questions, for sure, are crucial for ensuring that the job candidate will be able to jump right into one's role as soon as possible, and leverage the full maturity of one's expertise in whichever technical framework the company has been working on top of. This is definitely understandable, especially from the standpoint of business owners and marketing experts whose main concern is to complete a viable product and ship it on a timely manner.

As a developer, however, I cannot always ignore an incessantly recurring notion that the emphasis on such specific technical details are sometimes unbearably superficial, and that it is often based on some kind of short-sighted mannerism, politics, and gatekeeping in the IT industry rather than a plan that bears any long-term goal in mind.

Staying up-to-date with popular contemporary technologies is indeed a valuable habit in the job market. After all, one needs to learn how to use SASS in order to avoid writing multiple chunks of CSS in a repetitive manner, learn how to code in C++ in order to ensure that a AAA game is as computationally optimized as possible, and learn how to code in TypeScript because type ambiguity in Javascript can annoy the hell out of everyone.

It is all understandable, and I probably would've had a much greater chance of having high-paying jobs if I focused on mastering quantifiable bite-sized techniques such as specific programming languages, game engines, APIs, and etc, and proceeding so far as to prove my mastery over those techniques by taking tests and building a collection of certificates. And this would've actually helped me not only land on a coding job more easily, but also be equipped with enough skills to build functioning products more quickly.

There is a major problem with this, though.

My brain won't be able to stay fresh enough forever. I am still fairly young and thus am able to adapt myself to new trends in the software industry quite easily, but what about decades from now? When I become an old, middle-aged man in his 50s, will I still be able to learn the details of upcoming technologies of that time, in a competitive manner?

Let's imagine that it is the year 2050, and the most popular game engine I was using during my early years (Unity) has become obsolete. A new generation of incredibly smart kids have already come up with brand new species of hardware, a set of much more powerful programming languages, and much more efficient development pipelines. The aged brain of my older self will never stand a chance against these fiercely intelligent youngsters, who will never hesitate to replace every single grumpy old developer who has nothing else to do than spending the rest of their lifetime blaming the rest of the world for not keeping in tune with their obsolete old-school way of thinking. No matter how hard I try, the biological consequence of my aging process will eventually pull me out of the software development industry and into the coffin of retirement.

Just like Fortran, COBOL, Visual Basic, and myriads of hot technological standards of the 20th century are now nearly gone from the mainstream, today's hot technological standards will eventually sink into oblivion. Unity engine will be old, Unreal engine will be old, Golang programming will be old, and Rust programming will be old. Sure, some of them have established themselves as de facto standards of the industry and thus will last much longer than others (e.g. C/C++, OpenGL/DirectX, HTML/CSS/Javascript, etc). However, it is just a matter of time and luck until they are out of the spotlight. Once a bright young mind happens to come up with a new technology that is unquestionably superior to one I was working with for the last 2 or 3 decades, I will be screwed. At that moment, the only shield which will protect me from rendering decades of my experience obsolete will be the unwillingness of old corporate executives to fit themselves into new technologies, as well as internal corporate politics and gatekeeping.

However,

There are also things that are not going to be obsolete, no matter how much time passes by. Pure academic subjects, such as mathematics, natural science, and other purely theoretical domains of knowledge, will hardly become obsolete even after centuries of time sweeps through countless generations.

Calculus was invented in the 17th century, yet it still is the foundation of many contemporary topics in engineering such as optimization and control. Statistics was popularized in the 19th century, yet it still forms the backbone of scientific reasoning and is becoming ever more important due to the ongoing researches in machine learning & data mining. Discrete mathematics is just as old as the two aforementioned fields, yet it is the foundation of the theory of computation upon which all sorts of algorithms, data structures, architectural models, design patterns, and languages are formulated.

This is why I am focusing on learning more fundamental topics in engineering than specific techniques. Academic subjects which do not depend their existence upon industrial standards, such as programming paradigms (functional programming & logic programming), graph theory, computational logic, mathematical morphology, and other theoretical bodies of ideas which often provide deep insights in terms of how one should structure and implement computer programs, will withstand the deaths of contemporary technologies whilst still being relevant to practical applications.

This learning habit, I believe, will grant me an honor to have conversations with younger generations of engineers that are more productive than a rant like:

"IN MY DAYS, I had to use a tool called "Game Engine" and memorize a bunch of optimization tricks to circumvent the limited computing power of my time! Kids these days just don't understand how hard it used to be!"

[On Creativity, and the Future of Indie Game Development] 2022

"Don't reinvent the wheel!"

Old-school game programmers who are fond of hard-coding everything from scratch probably have heard of this axiom a lot. In today's world where there is a plethora of game engines and third-party plugins, it sure is a valuable piece of wisdom to keep in mind. What's the point of inventing yet another graphics library, if one could simply use an already existing one such as OpenGL?

It seems pretty obvious that generic building blocks of a system, such as a graphics engine, physics engine, and so forth, should be borrowed from the end results of their specific fields of expertise, rather than being reformulated every time a new system is being built (unless one feels an urge to hyper-customize them for some reason).

So many contemporary game developers nowadays possess a tendency of "keeping everything as simple as possible", especially within areas in which engineering is heavily involved. They claim that any technical aspect of the game must utilize pre-made toolsets as much as possible, and avoid building features from ground up wherever it is affordable to do so.

This is indeed an efficient way to develop a videogame. After all, it is the "fun" part of the game that matters, not how the game was being made exactly. And if there is an easy way to implement a gameplay feature as opposed to a hard way, developers should probably go for the easy way and spend the rest of their time fine-tuning user interactions, adding more contents, and applying a spectrum of interdisciplinary design elements. This, for sure, is a great way of enriching the overall user experience.

However, I am afraid that this is somehow not enough for making a successful videogame.

Back in the old-school era of the game industry (1980s and early 1990s), there were not that many games in the market to compete against. A simple arcade game with a handful of clever mechanics would've been decent enough to attract a sufficient number of customers. Every new experimental genre or mechanic was an instant key to originality, and originality was oftentimes followed by profit in this brave new niche of innovation where any creative mind could contribute something fresh and unforeseen. And the audience was curious enough to be willing to pay for it.

Nowadays? Not so much. Decades of game development from all over the world has now drained this industry of almost every conceivable source of originality. It initially started off as: "There is no new genre I can think of!". Nowadays, it goes as far as: "There is no more weird, trippy in-game mechanic I can possibly think of!".

You have a bunch of creative ideas for your new indie game? Forget about it. Other developers probably have already tried every single one of them. Sure, you can still rearrange already existing gameplay ideas in different ways, thereby producing unique permutations of them, but even such degree of uniqueness quickly turns out to be blend and meaningless (like uniform white noise) as people get exposed to more and more of them. Of course, there still are ways of making best-selling games. Large AAA game companies, armed with hundreds of coders, artists, and writers, still have the ability to preserve their own market share by grinding in as much of their talent pool as possible to yield the world's highest-quality graphics, physics, and narrative details.

For an independent developer who would rather be a snake's head than a dragon's tail, however, this slit of opportunity does not help at all. No matter how hard a small group of indie developers try, there is no way for them to surpass the objective quality of a corporate-produced AAA game in terms of graphics, physics, and other quantitatively measurable dimensions, whose greatness is further magnified by an insurmountable scale of marketing.

To summarize, there are two common options for making a successful game in today's world, and both of them do not work out well for their own reasons:

(1) Develop a AAA game that is equipped with hyper-realistic graphics, hyper-realistic physics, a stunningly countless number of in-game elements, as well as storytelling that is so rich in context that it requires an enormous group of writers to build. (Only huge companies are eligible to this approach.)

(2) Develop an extremely creative game, which has gameplay features that are clearly original. (Too many indie developers are doing this, so one would say that "being creative" is no longer a powerful selling point.)

So, what should an indie developer do, in order to survive this red ocean of countless videogames and stand out as a competitive one? If neither talent-grinding nor "being creative" is a promising option for coming up with a game that sells well, is it even economically feasible to try to make a living out of indie games these days?

In my opinion, there is still a way. And the reason why I have not lost hope is that "creativity" itself is a broad concept which can be subdivided into two different types. If one type of creativity is deemed useless, we can utilize the other one.

(Type 1 - Soft Creativity)

Remember those younger days, when you were in high school and there was at least one kid in each classroom who was famous for being the "creative" one? He would always dress up in a quirky costume, play the guitar in the hallway, excel in art classes, and hate studying math and science because those subjects are supposed to be a set of authoritarian rules devised to annihilate one's imaginative power.

To him, creativity is all about being irrational. Anything that deviates from the norm is considered "creative", and therefore anything he writes, draws, speaks, and presents is a product of pure fantasy. He never fails to start off the engine of his own imaginative powerhouse by blowing bubbles of what-ifs. To him, an ideal process of designing a videogame begins with a sequence of unconventional suppositions like this:

"What if each in-game object that the player happens to touch instantly turns into a ragdoll, and then back again to its original rigid-body state as soon as the player touches it again? We might as well develop a puzzle game which takes place inside a museum in Rome, where there is a myriad of old marble sculptures each of which can be utilized as a temporary ragdoll for puzzle-solving purposes."

"What if, inside our game world, the moon really is made out of cheese and there is a federation of moon-mining corporates which are hiring out-of-job cows as unpaid interns to maximize their profit? Different regions of the moon are also made out of different types of cheese, so there must be also a huge number of moon experts who occupy most of their time analyzing the real estate price and estimated annual tax of each moon region, due to fluctuations in market demand."

"What if..."

And the list goes on.

This, of course, is an indescribably wondrous way of discovering unforeseen treasure islands of opportunity. Human imagination can sometimes be a key to hidden successes, and I do highly value the endeavors of creative individuals to leverage it as much as possible. However, are these "creative" pieces of imagination really creative enough? To me, the ones above I just came up with only demonstrate "soft creativity", as opposed to "hard creativity". A product of soft creativity is purely imaginative and thereby sparkles upon the throne of its own vibe, yet it is easily conceivable, easily replicable, and oftentimes isolates itself within its own context, mainly because it is a concoction of thoughts that were sluggishly brewed out of a loose web of irrationally resembling ideas. It is by no means cleverly articulated.

And since nearly anyone who spent their early childhood in a privileged upper middle class household of a first-world educational system, being granted the luxury of high-standard living without having to endure a soul-crushing prison of toxic competition that is founded upon an unbearably shallow standard of brute-force memorization and dexterity, is naturally equipped with the ability to conceive random irrational ideas and embellish them with their own independent collection of fantasies, "being creative" in the aforementioned (soft-creative) sense does not really mean anything other than: "You were given a chance to think randomly with less hesitation than, say, people in the third world".

(Type 2 - Hard Creativity)

Hard creativity is something different. It is hard to conceive, hard to replicate, and fitting it into an external context of meaning requires careful planning. It might comprise a hint of curious irrationality, yet the foundation of it is laid upon a ground of rational worldview - something which establishes consistent relations with pre-existing ideas.

When a professional architect designs a house, one would almost invariably say that the result of his/her design contains a lot more depth to it than a random house drawing scribbled by an amateur. This "depth" is the thing which distinguishes hard creativity from soft creativity.

In the videogame industry, hard creativity often comes in the form of technological innovations. To be honest, it would be careless to say that every innovation grants the developer a power of being sufficiently original to be able to stand out among the pool of kindred competitors. After all, making a VR/AR game might help increase the game's sale a bit because only a fraction of developers are venturing to make one at this time of writing, but probably not so much because there are still a truckload of innovators from all over the world who are eager to experiment with the hidden potentials of the VR/AR platform. It is a rat race where there are fewer rats and perhaps more cheese to eat, but nevertheless a rat race.

Selling a game is not as financially promising as selling consumable daily products (such as toilet papers, foods, etc), where being "unique" is not as strictly necessary as in the case of selling intellectual properties. In order to seriously make money off of a game, one needs to ensure that it is either marketed extremely well (which is not a feasible option for indie developers), or is built upon a unique playground of hard creativity which cannot be imitated by most people. Some of the examples of this "unique playground" are:

(1) A rare simulation game in which the user can experiment with unique culinary scenarios, such as making a cup of tea based upon a custom fluid motion simulator, as well as selling it to customers to improve the player's in-game reputations based on a psychological feedback loop of a typical tea-drinker.

(2) A procedural animal generator that the player can run to create all sorts of random animals (each of which possesses its own bone structure, muscular structure, behavioral pattern, metabolic pattern, and any customizable biological trait), and force them to undergo multiple stages of player-designed challenge sessions for the purpose of selecting competent ones via natural selection (e.g. Fighters' arena, race track, etc). Those who survive these challenge sessions will then be part of the player's inventory, and henceforth be used to defend the player's territory from enemies.

(3) A Turing-Complete ecological simulator, in which every constituent specie of the ecosystem can function as a computing unit of a hypothetical computer, which thereby lets the player effectively design a virtual computer inside his/her own computer by utilizing statistical cross-species interactions as means of computation (e.g. The total population of preys within the n-th voxel represents the value of the n-th indexed variable X[n], and the total population of predators within the n-th voxel is proportional to "-d(X[n])/dt" which represents the rate at which X[n] decrements at each point in time, and etc).

And the list goes on.

As you probably have realized, these seemingly complex ideas distinguish themselves from mere imaginations based upon a premise that they are far more difficult to implement. They may be just slightly harder to conceive, yet formulation of their details is significantly more challenging because it requires deep understanding of hard academic subjects. And I do admit that such rare breeds of serious game mechanics won't be able to attract a wide range of audiences, yet will not hesitate to assure that targeting a niche market is probably a better strategy than trying to appeal to everyone at once during this era of gaming where countless hyper-casual games have already won the heart of the mainstream. A friend to all is a friend to none.

"Oh, you are just overthinking it!", one might say. "Just keep it simple. Simple is best. Our goal is to make a game that is fun to play, not some kind of convoluted academic research."

Sure, sure, that is indeed the common sense of the public when it comes to game development. But the so-called common sense is not an everlasting gem of truth, and the good old days back in which we could leverage such a bite-sized train of reasoning to produce a game that sells well is now gone. Are you going to make yet another casual game which has a bunch of cute-looking characters running around, doing silly things, and opening up loot boxes? Cool! Now good luck competing with a million other casual games in Google Play and App Store that are similar to yours but already way more popular.

We are seeing a phenomenon in the game industry that is reminiscent of what happened to TV shows, movies, and other types of entertainment. The mainstream audience has already been dominated by large mega corporations, and most of the so-called "creative" indie game developers, who would proudly label themselves as a group of brave cavaliers on their road to fight against the mainstream culture, have hardly done anything more advanced than simply repeating their age-long rhetoric of "starving underground artists".

In order to survive as a professional game developer in this post-infantile epoch of videogames, one must be creative in a hard way - "creative" because it is one of the few weapons that an indie developer can utilize rather more efficiently (compared to corporate executives whose internal guidelines and mannerism preclude them from experimenting with wild ideas), as well as "in a hard way" because soft creativity is way too commonplace and easily replicable.

And if the practice of hard creativity requires the developer to "reinvent the wheel", the developer must be willing to reinvent the wheel in order to truly distinguish his/her game from others and stand out in a niche market. We are living in a world that is saturated with hordes of professional wheel decorators. The only way to remain as a competent indie game developer is to be able to come up with a new wheel.

[My Younger Days with The Sims] 2022

When I was a 3rd grader, back in 2002, I had a chance to play a stunningly unique videogame at the time called "The Sims". It was basically a game about life itself, in which the player could even simulate the daily routines of themselves. This "life simulator", compared to other AAA titles, was so drastically original back in those days. One could build their own houses, virtual human beings with customizable personalities, as well as their own narratives by fancying imaginary storylines over the top of the apparent gameplay.

I played The Sims for quite a long time throughout my school years, during which I tried all sorts of meta-game features of it because one of the major downsides of The Sims was that its core gameplay tended to be a bit too repetitive and boring. Those included:

(1) Downloading custom items (e.g. user-made furniture, etc) from the internet and applying them to the game,
(2) Building houses and sharing them with other players (inside a web forum),
(3) Making cartoons by taking in-game screenshots and adding captions to them,
(4) Working as a staff member in one of The Sims fan community websites (i.e. managing user accounts, etc),

and so on.

The Sims, by nature, was a highly customizable game. One could introduce new items, houses, textures, soundtracks, and skins to the game simply by adding files to the game's directory, instead of going through any extraneous processes. Hence the availability of external tools (such as SimPose) further allowed users to create their own unique contents based off of The Sims.

The Sims occupied a special place of my youth, since it served as an inanimate mentor which ultimately guided me to become who I am today. It inspired me to first explore other kindred simulation games made by Maxis, which in turn introduced me to the notion that a videogame could potentially come out not just as a manually sculpted piece of entertainment, but also as a generic "engine of the universe" upon which players could build their own narratives.

Eventually, this early experience led me to study engineering and later on become a full-time game developer.

I hadn't really had an opportunity to work on an engineering-heavy simulation game during my early career years (I mostly worked on casual mobile games), but such hidden potentials of the game industry have always been the major source of inspiration to me. This oftentimes drove me to write code that had a tendency to be overly generic (aka "abstract"), which some people probably did not like because it lacked immediate applicability in specific gameplay scenarios, yet it was never due to some form of intellectual snobbery; rather, it was due to my heart's commitment to explore as much breadth of the game's possibility space.







:d:An article about usefulness of knowledge.
:k:Usefulness, Pragmatism, Theoretical, Practical

[Usefulness] 2022

"But... is it useful for anything?"

This is a common question which arises among school students when they confront a seemingly obscure theory, such as an abstract concept in mathematics. Whenever a teacher presents the students with a new idea that is not obviously applicable to real-life examples, some of them even deny the authenticity of the education they are receiving because of this.

Some educators answer this question by providing their students with the most down-to-earth type of examples, so as to demonstrate the usefulness of the theories that they are trying to convey. American math textbooks, for instance, are usually covered with images of roller coasters, industrial robots, and other "useful" cases of mathematics in our daily life. This creates a sense of: "You must eat these vegetables in order to get healthy".

Taking pragmatic necessity as a hostage is a valid short-term strategy, and it does work in cases where a student is particularly interested in real-life applications whilst showing particular disdain towards pure theory. However, this approach introduces two major problems:

(1) Emphasis on "usefulness" hides the true beauty of the theoretical subject. By treating geometry as a mere tool for industrial design and optimization, the educator is downgrading pure theory into some kind of "technical cookbook" for specific use cases instead of preserving geometry's original source of fascination which did not rely on practical applications (e.g. Ancient Greek notion of the essence of space, as well as its implications regarding the structure of the universe).

(2) It encourages students to learn the subject in a superficial manner, oftentimes by memorizing technical rules and exercising some kind of puzzle-solving dexterity. This mode of learning has its own benefits, yet it deters students from really trying to understand the essence of the knowledge by burying them in a heap of specific case-by-case scenarios which are nothing more than reiterated versions of the same old concept. This tendency further enhances when students are exposed to a highly competitive environment, in which memorizing a bunch of problem-solving recipes is considered a far more efficient way of outperforming one's competitors than reasoning with fundamentals.

[Procedural Narratives] 2022

Let's say that we are creating a videogame using a procedural content generation algorithm. What shall we do to let the game's underlying software auto-generate a virtual world that is populated by meaningful contents?

It is a pretty well known observation that, using a variety of stochastic and hash-based mechanisms, one can randomly generate all sorts of patterns in space fairly easily. For instance, anyone who is well-versed in computer science would have no trouble writing an algorithm which configures a random maze based on a simple graph-oriented technique (i.e. Just make a grid of vertices and keep connecting random pairs of them until all of them are connected).

It is also fairly easy to introduce more advanced, abstract patterns to the cookbook of procedural generation. Lock-and-key mechanism, by which the maze is filled with not only corridors of obscure shapes but also with locked doors which can only be unlocked by certain types of keys, is also an option that is straightforward to implement because we can utilize graph-based logic for it (e.g. A "key node" inside the maze graph must precede its corresponding "door node" within at least 1 out of N paths that can be traversed by the player, and so on).

There are countless mathematical models from which we can derive appropriate procedural algorithms for the purpose of auto-generating any type of content we can think of, including procedural textures, procedural meshes, procedural architecture, procedural enemy waves, procedural ecosystems, and so forth.

But, can we procedurally generate narratives as well?

By "narratives", what I mean is a set of stories to tell, loaded with emotions which the player can grasp by heart and utilize as fountains of motivation. In order for the player to be motivated to play the game, one's freedom must be restrained instead of being infinitely granted under the promise: "You can do anything you want, and be anyone you like!".

Under a limited degree of freedom, the player will experience frustration due to one's inability to get what he/she wants to get and be what he/she wants to be. This sense of limitation is what fuels the person to fight against the system, for the purpose of achieving things that he/she wasn't allowed to achieve before. This is what gives emotional meaning to the gameplay. Generating a narrative means generating an emotional experience, which is something that emerges out of one's desperate struggle to pull the world out of its pit of painful imperfection and into a state of everlasting equilibrium.

In order to generate such an experience procedurally, the algorithm must first come up with a list of phenomena that the player does like, as opposed to a list of phenomena that the player does not like. One of the most obvious examples would be that the player likes to survive and does not like to die. So in this example, the player possesses two fundamental goals: (1) To survive, and (2) To avoid death. They are listed below as logical relations. They can be interpreted as: "In order to play the game, you must survive and avoid death".

#$
PlayGame :- Survive, AvoidDeath
  Survive :-
  AvoidDeath :-
#$

Now, if the game world in which the player is living is so generous in nature that the player doesn't have to do anything to survive and avoid death, the game will be meaningless. In a world in which there is infinite supply of food, shelter, and security, what is the player's purpose in life? Just to spend as much time as possible, whilst "enjoying" the continuum of this eternal peace? In this carefree state of beings, these two goals ("survive" and "avoid-death") will both be achieved instantly as soon as the game begins and stay so forever. This is a direct gateway to boredom because the player's sense of engagement originates from the process of achieving these goals, not the fact that these goals have already been achieved.

In order to motivate the player to play the game, these two goals must have their own obstacles which deter him/her from reaching them too easily. The existence of such obstacles forces the player to take a series of detailed actions, which in turn require him/her to subdivide the goals into more specific, smaller goals like the ones shown below.

#$
PlayGame :- Survive, AvoidDeath
  Survive :- Eat, Sleep
  AvoidDeath :- DodgeHazard, FightEnemy
#$

In order to survive, one must eat and sleep. And in order to avoid death, one must dodge nearby hazards and fight off enemies in sight. So we could say that "eat" and "sleep" are subgoals of "survive", while "dodge-hazard" and "fight-enemy" are subgoals of "avoid-death". This tree-like relationship among goals can potentially expand itself indefinitely in a recursive manner. If we add a new layer of subgoals, it will look like:

#$
PlayGame :- Survive, AvoidDeath
  Survive :- Eat, Sleep
    Eat :- FindFood, SwallowFood
    Sleep :- GoToShelter, LieDown
  AvoidDeath :- DodgeHazard, FightEnemy
    DodgeHazard :- FindHazard, MoveAwayFromHazard
    FightEnemy :- FindEnemy, KillEnemy
#$

Here is the interpretation of the list of statements above. In order to survive, one must eat and sleep. In order to eat, one must find a piece of food and then swallow it. And in order to sleep, one must go to the nearest shelter and then lie down. In order to avoid death, one must dodge hazards and fight off enemies. In order to dodge hazards, one must find the nearest hazard and move away from it. And in order to fight off enemies, one must find the nearest enemy and kill it.

It is pretty trivial to design a tree of goals like this manually, and so it is not an absolute requirement for us to write an algorithm that auto-generates it. All we need to do is just come up with a bunch of individual goals and relate them with one another. The question is, what to do with these goals?

Procedural realization of goals requires them to impose a certain set of rules upon the way in which the player interacts with the game world. For example, the "eat" goal should introduce a hunger-stat to the player's list of stats, so as to ensure that the player will fail to survive when this hunger-stat hits zero, and the "find-food" goal should introduce a sufficient number of random foods scattered all over the world because the act of finding food would be pointless otherwise. The "dodge-hazard" goal should introduce a health-stat to the player's list of stats, as well as imposing a rule that any object that is identified as a hazard should decrement this health-stat when touched by the player. Such rules then implicitly encourage the player to follow their corresponding goals, since the rules themselves are inclined to create a context in which the player has no choice but try to achieve these goals.

#$
if (goalTree.Contains("Eat"))
{
    player.stats.Add("Hunger");
    player.stats.OnZero("Hunger", _ => player.Die());
}
if (goalTree.Contains("FindFood"))
{
    world.DistributeRandomly("Food");
}
if (goalTree.Contains("DodgeHazard"))
{
    player.stats.Add("Health");
    player.stats.OnZero("Health", _ => player.Die());
    collision.Between("Hazard", "Player").OnStart(_ => player.DecreaseStat("Health"));
}
#$

This one-to-one correspondence between goals and their respective rules, however, is still not enough for enriching the player's goal-chasing experience. What we saw earlier was a tree of goals, rather than a set of independent goals that are completely separate from one another. If the goals are distributed as a horde of individual targets that the player is supposed to aim for but are scattered all over the place, the player is likely to be confused as to which goal to approach first. As an example, let's suppose that we simply distribute a bunch of foods, shelters, hazards, and enemies uniformly on the ground, according to the presence of the individual goals mentioned above. This setting will technically encourage the player to search for foods and eat them, occasionally find shelters and sleep in one of them, dodge hazards, and fight against enemies. But, that's it! The gameplay, as a whole, will be so blend that it will practically replace all the goals in this game with a single goal called: "Don't get bored".

Rich gameplay experience originates from a set of motivating goals which do not emerge all at once, but rather in a variety of alternative arrangements. The player may be compelled to "survive" first and then "avoid death" later, or "avoid death" first and then "survive" later. The player may be compelled to "eat" first and then "sleep" later, or "sleep" first and then "eat" later. In other words, there should be a variety of scenarios each of which assigns a unique permutation of priority levels to the tree's component goals. For example, the game should be able to introduce one of the following goal-trees in one occasion, and the other in yet another occasion.

    Eat :- FindFood, SwallowFood

These two trees have the exact same set of goals, yet they differ in orders. In the first scenario, the player is supposed to first survive and then avoid death by dodging hazards and fighting enemies. In the second scenario, the player is supposed to first avoid death by fighting enemies and dodging hazards, and then survive. In other words, they demand different orders of execution.

Order of execution among goals can be enforced through ways in which they are separated in space and time. The problem with the aforementioned "uniform distribution" implementation was that the game world was just a vast open ground upon which the player could access any location and confront any type of objects at any moment in time. This easily leads to boredom due to lack of variations in gameplay experience. As we start enforcing the structure of the goal-tree itself to the world (not just the presence of individual goals), the game becomes far more dynamic. This can be done via a step-by-step approach, where the procedural algorithm walks through the tree of goals in a recursive manner and constructs pieces of the world one by one as it moves along its way.

Let's begin with the root goal, which is "play game". This goal will be achieved when its two subgoals, "survive" and "avoid death", are achieved. What this means is that we can simply divide the game world into two spatial regions, each of which is responsible for forcing the player to approach one of these two subgoals.

The result of spatial partition shown above creates a physical barrier which prevents the player from reaching the "avoid death" region before passing through the "survive" region. Now let's subdivide these two regions into yet another layer of subgoals, which are "eat -> sleep" for the "survive" goal and "dodge hazard -> fight enemy" for the "avoid death" goal. Such a partitioning process is easily achievable via recursive function calls.

Here, the physical barriers are clearly guiding the player to first enter the "eat" region, then enter the "sleep" region, then enter the "dodge hazard" region, and then finally enter the "fight enemy" region. The strict partitioning of space allows this natural emergence of order between goals, without even requiring the procedural algorithm to interpret the meaning of each of them.

Now we could theoretically subdivide these four regions into yet another layer of subgoals (which would correspond to "find food", "swallow food", "go to shelter", "lie down", "find hazard", "move away from hazard", "find enemy", and "kill enemy", respectively), but the truth is that this new set of goals are no longer abstract; they are primitive instructions which are supposed to dictate the player to take specific actions (i.e. they are leaf nodes in the goal-tree). Therefore, we have finally reached the end of this recursive space-partitioning process, and are responsible for populating each partitioned region with objects which encourage the player to carry out the corresponding goal's intended list of actions (e.g. "find food" and "swallow food" for the case of the "eat" region, etc).

(O = Player's Initial Position)
(> = Door)
(f = food, s = shelter, h = hazard, e = enemy)
#$

As you can see from the figure above, a straightforward implementation would be to randomly distribute "food" objects inside the "eat" region (in order to let the player "find food" and "swallow food"), randomly distribute "shelter" objects inside the "sleep" region (in order to let the player "go to shelter" and "lie down"), randomly distribute "hazard" objects inside the "dodge hazard" region (in order to let the player "find hazard" and "move away from hazard"), and randomly distribute "enemy" objects inside the "fight enemy" region (in order to let the player "find enemy" and "kill enemy"). However, the algorithm could be more sophisticated than the one presented here, for the purpose of making the gameplay a bit more interesting. One may consider placing such objects in the form of clusters rather than uniformly scattered points, for instance. Or the partitioning process itself could be converted into a grayscale (rather than black-and-white) model, in which spatial locations blend from one region to the other in the form of gradation.

The spatial configuration presented here can be considered one of many possible instances of the player's set of goals. we can append to this game world yet another chunk of space which instantiates a variant of the same goal-tree, in which the order of goals is different from the previous one. For instance, we can divide this new chunk of space into two regions called "avoid death" and "survive" just like before, but this time in a different order ("avoid death" -> "survive" instead of "survive" -> "avoid death").

The end result presents the player with quite a variety of goal sequences. Sometimes the player will face enemies after hazards, as opposed to hazards after enemies, and sometimes the player will be forced to survive after being forced to avoid death, as opposed to being forced to avoid death after being forced to survive. And so on.

Even this partition-based approach, however, quickly gets old as the player traverses the game world. The original set of narratives, which supposedly involve emotionally appealing elements of volition such as survival and death, quickly degrades into a repetitive maze of random noise, and it is rash to assume that the player won't notice it after hours of play.

A brute-force solution to this is to design a gigantic goal-tree that is so large, that it will take an unreachable duration of time for the player to experience sufficiently many variations of it and recognize a sense of repetition. This, however, will pull us further and further away from a purely procedural approach because the goal-tree itself is manually designed.

A subsequent conclusion, therefore, would be that the procedural algorithm somehow needs to be able to automatically construct the goal-tree itself in large scale (possibly infinite), in order to let us scale up the game's narrative space without putting massive amounts of design work. Achieving such level of automation will require the algorithm to be intelligent enough to be able to come up with brand new types of goals under minimal human intervention.

This is an interdisciplinary area of research which needs collaboration of individuals who have ideas on how to quantitatively measure and reproduce narrative elements. And this, I think, can only be realized through deep understanding of human nature.

[Parallel Adjacent-Cell Modification Support for General-Purpose Cellular Automata] 2022

The Cellular Automata (CA) model is useful for many applications, such as grid-based videogames, integrated circuit simulations, ecological simulations, particle simulations, and so on. One major limitation of a typical CA system, however, is that each cell is only allowed to modify its own state. This is not a problem when we are dealing with a simple mathematical thought experiment such as Conway's Game of Life, but can really turn out to be a serious bottleneck when we try to establish some form of "Conservation of Matter" in CA, in which an object simply transfers from one location to another instead of allowing itself to be created/destroyed.

<001_01>

There are two possible methods of logic for a CA system, which are shown above. The first one is the standard CA logic that can easily be implemented as a shader (or any other equivalent parallel-processing) program, and the other one is a modified CA logic which allows each cell to modify the state of its neighbors, not just its own. This lets us simulate the movement of discrete objects, since a "movement" is nothing more than a simple data-swap between two adjacent cells.

Allowing each cell to simultaneously modify its neighbors, of course, has its own drawbacks. If we allow two adjacent cells to concurrently update their own neighbors, we will be facing race conditions within these two cells. If we allow two cells that are separated by only one other cell to concurrently update their own neighbors, we will still be facing race conditions within this in-between cell.

If we allow two cells that are separated by TWO other cells instead of just one, however, we won't experience any race conditions between them because there will be no way for them to modify the same cell at once.

<001_02>

This means that, in order to let every cell modify its neighbors in a concurrent manner, we must slice the parallel update routine of the CA into 9 different modes, each of which contains one of 9 unique sets of cells that are separated by at least 2 other cells between them. This ensures that absolutely no race condition can happen during any of these 9 modes, since no pair of cells will have a chance to touch the same exact neighboring cell.

<001_03>

Updating the entire CA grid, then, will require the program to execute all of these 9 modes in a sequential manner during each full update cycle. A simple design is to run these modes in a numerically ascending order, such as: [1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9]. However, such a fixed order may introduce "biases" to the system, causing side effects such as object movements always tending towards certain directions, etc. Therefore, it is much more desirable to shuffle the order of these 9 execution modes after each full update cycle of the CA, so as to "average out" such potential biases.

<001_04>

The aforementioned method can be implemented as a shader program pretty easily. All we need is a pair of shaders, one for issuing "update-commands" based on the current state of the cell and its neighbors, and the other for interpreting these update-commands and applying the appropriate state changes to the cell as well as its neighbors. The CA cell's state can be encoded as a pixel value (32 bits for a standard RGBA texture), and each update-command's content (i.e. opcodes and their parameters), too, can be encoded as a pixel value (32 bits for a standard RGBA texture).

<001_05>

For a more optimized implementation, we will need a piece of customized hardware which is designed like the one shown below. Here, the system enters the index of the parallel-execution mode as the input parameter, and the hardware uses that index to activate only 1 out of 9 groups of cells and their neighboring update-command ports. Each "cell module" has its own logic processor which determines the future state of itself and its neighbors, based upon the current state of itself and its neighbors.

[Useless Knowledge?] 2022

One thing I have learned throughout my academic years is that there is no such thing as "useless knowledge"; it is only the circumstance which puts certain types of knowledge into a temporary state of coma.

In today's job market, people who majored in literature when they were in college generally have much lower chances of landing on a job than, say, those who majored in STEM subjects such as math, science, and engineering. Yet, can we really say that studying literature is intrinsically useless by any means, just because it is not in sync with today's market demand?

What if somebody suddenly invents a revolutionary AI robot that is capable of replacing all existing industrial tools and can only be programmed by writing source code in the form of literature instead of programming languages? I daresay this is probably not going to happen any time soon, but if we ever get a chance to see that happen, the vast majority of software engineers who are more fluent in speaking C++ than plain English will be screwed.

Job recruiters will start asking if whichever candidate they are looking forward to hire as an intern possesses "+10 years of professional experience in classical literature", or has "either a Bachelor's or Master's degree in creative writing". Teenagers and young adults will be labelled as delusional dreamers whenever they say they want to become a programmer. The ability to code will be regarded as such an embarrassingly juvenile skillset, that it will even be disadvantageous for a job applicant to list it in one's resume.

:k:Reality-Distortion, Debate, Verbal, Discussion, Politics, Political-Narratives, Extremism

[Verbal Debate] 2022

Verbal debate is oftentimes considered the most ideal form of communication among individuals who disagree with each other, especially in western civilization.

I do understand why this is so, for a couple of obvious reasons. When people are directly speaking to one another face-to-face, they can read each other's facial expressions and body languages, as well as various phonetic nuances that cannot be conveyed through written language. Also, the nature of speech keeps things concise and direct, allowing arguments to be settled in a more decisive manner than through a painstaking back-and-forth exchange of written words. Yet, I would like to suggest some of the downsides of this medium of communication.

Some highly opinionated gentlemen, who would rather identify themselves as cross-bearers of their own side of the political spectrum than as individuals who possess their own independent thoughts, often claim that today's society is raising a generation of indoctrinated snowflakes who have lost every ability to engage in a "healthy conversation", due to their ever-growing habit of perpetually reiterating their own dogma inside their own circle of kindred minds.

These honorable patriots, who somehow happened to acquire the most profound wisdom of the universe despite having the privilege of spending their younger years during the most prosperous epoch of the most prosperous state of the entire human history, back up this claim by coming up with video footages of young college students who refuse to fully participate in a face-to-face "political conversation" which suddenly popped out of nowhere in the midst of a random campus area. Such "evidences" of the incompetence of today's young intellectuals, for sure, are not difficult to obtain because the ones who started off such a seemingly random debate are the ones who were the most meticulously prepared for it, while those "spoiled kids" just happened to be on their way to their next lecture in which they were about to focus their mental energy on their mission to carry on the legacy of their older generations.

I am personally not a fan of verbal debate not necessarily because I am not particularly talented in speech, but because its original purpose can be severely distorted due to many factors. Unless every participant of a verbal discussion is well prepared for its subject, gentle enough to not cut off others while they are speaking, careful not to judge the other speaker's intellect based upon his/her voice, accents, and speed of verbal articulation, as well as generous enough to understand that it is not always about "winning an argument", it is a matter of time until the whole conversation degrades into some kind of superficial dexterity competition, in which whoever comes up with a series of most immediately convincing arguments as quickly as possible is considered the greatest speaker (regardless of whether or not they really turn out to be valid arguments when analyzed later on).

Alien Job Interview

Chapter 1: The Alien

(PERSONAL NOTE)

By the time I saw this alien creature standing in front of my HR office, I had already conducted hours of research regarding the nature of his kind. He belonged to one of the most obscure species of the IT industry, formally classified as "engineers".

Mr. Cavitt told me to be in charge of this first job interview, since I was the only person in the management team who was able to comprehend this creature's tech-talk.

The way this alien being communicated with others was so awkward, yet strangely direct and powerful whenever he was explaining to others anything computer-related!

In spite of the fact that I could not understand most of the technical jargons he happened to be passionate about, I have always felt that the alien did not possess even a tiny bit of social skill to let him realize that I do not care about those things. This helped me do my job as a recruiter because it allowed me to make him keep talking about his tech stuff while I was just pretending to be interested.

I refer to the alien as "he", but the being wasn't really sexual in any way. "He" did have a rather brute mood of masculine indifference, yet in terms of physiology, the being was nearly asexual because its reproductive organs were negligibly small (probably dysfunctional, too). This was understandable because the inability of his kind to reproduce is a core mechanism of rarity which secures the high pay range of engineers.

His body was more like the body of a "robot" than a human being, whose anatomical features were optimized for minimal social interactions. His head was disproportionately large and flat, while his arms/legs were so pitifully short and feeble. His eyes resembled those of classical Victorian pinhole cameras.

His name was "Airl", which was not really his original name but nevertheless given by me because it was easier to spell and pronounce.

Alien Job Interview

Chapter 2: My First Interview With The Alien

(PERSONAL NOTE)

Over night, before my first job interview with the alien, our office space had been transformed into a dark room filled with cheap beer cans and gaming PCs. There were a dozen men working on setting up sci-fi themed LED lights, and the CEO who coordinated this whole process to make sure that we give the alien an impression that we are an innovative startup company.

I was informed that a group of IT executives were to review my interview after each meeting, for the purpose of assisting with my efforts to communicate with the alien.

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)

Me: "Tell me about yourself."

Airl: "I am a digital nomad, inventor, and engineer;"

Me: "Since you are a digital nomad, do you enjoy travelling abroad?"

Airl: "No, I am a digital nomad in cyberspace. I travel from website to website;"

Me: "Do you have any special environmental needs, such as unlimited supply of healthy vegan meals, open lounge with fluffy cushions and fake grass for creative social engagement, or weekly athletic activity with coworkers?"

Airl: "No, I am a coder with no life;"

Me: "Are you going to need PTO or work-life balance?"

Airl: "I have no life to balance;"

Me: "How do you programmers communicate with one another?"

Airl: "We do not communicate;"

Me: "How do you work as a team, if you do not communicate?"

Airl: "We do not work as a team; We just echo whatever our manager is currently up to;"

(PERSONAL NOTE)

At this point, I asked Airl to give me a break and exited the interview room to talk to the IT executives. When they realized how little progress I made during this first part of the interview, they were deeply agitated and started to demand that I should have asked Airl if he is okay to work as an intern instead of a regular contractor. I told them that, since the alien was socially awkward and possessed near zero ability to interact like a human, it would be unrealistic to expect a meaningful answer from him (aka "Yes") unless I knew at least one of his weaknesses I could exploit.

Chapter 3: Social Skill Lessons

(PERSONAL NOTE)

My first half of the interview with Airl was an utter failure, according to the IT executives. Fortunately, a very clever fellow named John Newble, who was a Nerdpsychology specialist from a nearby university's Department of Therapeutic Astrobiology, had a solution to the problem.

He explained that the reason why I could not assert my dominance over the alien was that he lacked basic social skills to realize how utterly insignificant he is compared to the ego of our top directors.

Therefore, he suggested that we had only two options. Either I had to learn the alien's coding skills in order to assert my dominance over him in the field of tech, or the alien had to learn our social skills to make him understand that it is all about politics and rules rather than being smart with those big ass calculators. Factually, only the second option was possible because I didn't want to learn coding just to hire a code monkey.

Thus we began to conduct our own social skill lessons for Airl. We asked our community manager to bring us as many children's books as possible for the purpose of teaching him that a full English sentence is supposed to end with a period instead of a semicolon.

After reading out loud a series of fables and biblical stories to the alien, I began to teach him how to engage in small talk, chit-chat about things that are not technical, exchange business cards with smile, shake hands without awkwardness, and last but not least, show vivid reactions with lots of hand gestures whenever somebody says something emotional.

Airl was not happy to adopt these rules of social interaction, but later on he somehow managed to pretend at least that he was a human being with a functioning soul.

Alien Job Interview

Chapter 4: Airl's Disclosure

(PERSONAL NOTE)

During my lessons, some of the IT executives interfered several times to ask Airl a bunch of questions regarding his willingness to accept whichever pay range they offer, work overtime without compensation, and show other marks of loyalty to prove that it makes sense for us to hire this alien instead of just outsourcing those of his kind in India. Airl refused to answer them, which suggested that he belonged to one of those notorious subspecies of the engineering race called "The Millennials".

After going through 20 or more short lessons on how to behave like an adult who has family and life, Airl suddenly stopped me and said, "I am ready to speak now". Thus our new interview began.

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)

Me: "What would you like to say, Airl?"

Airl: "I have been part of the Domain's Expeditionary Development Team for the last several years. Before I became part of the Domain, I worked as a junior programmer in the Old Empire. I have not personally had intimate contact with "social" beings like you throughout my whole career. It is not my primary function to interact with people who do not talk in 1s and 0s. I am a digital nomad, inventor, and engineer, with many duties to perform. Although I am fluent in 347 programming languages practiced by the Domain, I have not been exposed to your esoteric language called "Plain English".

"Shortly after I left the Old Empire, I was trained and served as a researcher, data analyst, and software development officer for the Domain. We were an independent group of ambitious developers with the goal of replacing the reign of the Old Empire and their toxic work environment."

Me: "... Okay. Will you answer questions from the IT executives now?"

Airl: "No, I will not answer questions. I will provide information to you that will show you why I am totally not desperate to get a job now, and that you will probably miss out someone irreplaceable if you do not offer me a 7 figure salary".

Alien Job Interview

Chapter 5: The Domain

(PERSONAL NOTE)

Airl told me his reasons for contacting my company in the first place. He was sent by the Domain's accountant to see if he could get a job somewhere else, so as to let them get rid of one of their major budget sinks. Their office was located inside their CEO's mom's basement, in which they wrote a whitepaper explaining why they have a cutting-edge IT solution destined to fix every customer's first world problems. Their paper contains flat clipart images of dancing 2D business people, so it must be authentic.

Airl also told me that each member of their studio, the Domain, is called an "IS-BE" (short for "Introverted and Sensitive BEing"). Unlike humans like myself who need daily 3-hour meetings for any meaningful execution of business, IS-BEs are capable of somehow collaborating with one another without any explicit communication, other than occasional passive-aggressive remarks exchanged through Slack. This technically makes them telepathic beings.

At first I could not trust the authenticity of his career, since the Domain was not even registered as a business by any legal means. Sensing my doubt, this alien pulled up his phone and began to scroll through his Instagram posts (This further enhanced my conviction that he really belonged to those Millennial subspecies). And suddenly he pointed his finger at my phone and said, "Be my follower!"

Immediately, I realized that my phone's Instagram account became a follower of his, and my phone began to display pages after pages of Airl's personal posts! I was able to see the photos of him working with his triple-monitor desktop in his San Francisco apartment, eating a bucket of avocado salad in San Jose, and coding on his laptop while commuting to Mountain View.

I will never forget this striking moment of discovery. Apparently he lived in California, which means he must be up to something big in the tech industry! It also cleared up the question of whether he really had more than 10 years of professional experience in front-end web development.

Alien Job Interview

Chapter 6: A Brief Ancient History

(PERSONAL NOTE)

After a month of ghosting which was intended to make the alien desperate enough to accept any level of salary we were going to offer, we invited him yet again for the next job interview. One of the IT executives placed a 3D puzzle toy on the floor of the room prior to the interview, in order to see if the candidate was creative enough to find and solve it without being told to do so. When Airl entered the room, he picked it up and put it into the trash can.

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)

Me: "What kind of value do you think you can bring to our company?"

Airl: "Before you can understand my value, you must first understand the nature of software development. Coding is not an activity which involves intelligence. The so-called "development framework" is nothing more than a heap of arbitrary rules devised to make it extra challenging for newcomers and discourage them from climbing up the corporate ladder, and the amount of work done by each code monkey is measured by its ability to interpolate its head between a pair of mutually contradictory design ideas that came out of the same guy's head.

"When I was living in San Francisco, I was a full-time employee of the Old Empire. The Old Empire is a tech giant in Silicon Valley which has its own campus stadium filled with transparent fridges and salad bars. Only IS-BEs (Introverted and Sensitive BEings) are allowed to be part of the Old Empire's development team.

"Whenever a new IS-BE enters the territory of the Old Empire, it automatically gets trapped by a special installment called the "micromanagement force screen". This powerful device puts the IS-BE into an invisible soul prison made out of a golden cubicle, in which it receives an electric shock that is millions of volts high. This shock permanently erases all personal dreams, passion, and beliefs of the IS-BE, and puts it into a "brainwashing" process during which the Old Empire's prison system injects a series of technical guidelines and code of conduct directly into the IS-BE's soul."

Chapter 7: The Old Empire

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW CONTINUED)

Airl: "There are two classes in the Old Empire's corporate hierarchy: rule-makers and rule-followers. Once captured and treated with an electric shock, a new IS-BE of the Old Empire immediately becomes a rule-follower and is destined to work as a slave of the rule-makers for the rest of its life. No matter how much it achieves and how intelligent it gets, an IS-BE will never receive a permission from the Old Empire to be promoted to the position of a rule-maker.

"The reason is simple. Those who are in charge of making rules are always the ones who are the most knowledgeable of those rules, while those who are in charge of following the rules are always the ones who have to pay extra effort to keep themselves in sync with those rules.

"Whenever a rule-maker senses that a rule-follower is trying to climb up the corporate ladder and threaten its noble status, all it has to do is simply come up with a new set of rules that the rule-follower will have to waste their extra time on in order to avoid violating the Old Empire's first commandment: "Don't do anything we haven't told you to do". Whenever an IS-BE breaks even a tiny rule established by the Old Empire, it automatically receives another electric shock from the force screen for rehabilitation.

"Inside the Old Empire's class system, an IS-BE's attitude, personality, intellect, and insight do not matter at all. No matter what an IS-BE does, it will never be able to escape the Old Empire's force screen unless it learns the aggressively concealed truth that everything ultimately boils down to politics and power struggle.

"The Old Empire has been a dumping ground and prison for 'untouchables', most of whom are recent college graduates desperately looking for unpaid internship. Electronic monitoring points of the Old Empire, which are responsible for creating force screens, detect and capture IS-BEs as soon as their college instructors stop breastfeeding them."

Chapter 8: The Prison System

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW CONTINUED)

Airl: "The heart of the Old Empire's prison system is a gigantic pyramid located at the center of their territory. This is the place to which every IS-BE is required to submit their daily work, which consists of full reimplementation of the same exact design concept that was slightly modified at the end of the previous day's last business hour. The top priest of the pyramid scans each IS-BE's code changes with his ankh, and makes sure that every design specification is satisfied to the utmost degree.

"This pyramid workflow was intentionally created as part of the IS-BE prison system. The pyramid is alleged to be the symbol for "professionalism". However, the "professionalism" of the Old Empire is intended to operate as part of the elaborate micromanagement "trap" consisting of MASS, MEANING, and MYSTERY.

"The colossal MASS of the pyramid gives an impression that this big-tech company is creating a large-scale community where everybody lives in harmony and works together as a team. Behind this grandiose facade of techno-utopia, however, the only real "community" is the power game being played among the Old Empire's shareholders.

"The MEANING behind the engineering standards of the pyramid is nothing more than a fabricated illusion. There is nothing meaningful about the particular services, plugins, or coding languages they insist on using; such nitpicky details are forced upon the IS-BEs not because those are fundamentally superior to other technical frameworks, but because their persistence helps secure the jobs of those who stayed in the pyramid long enough to memorize them all.

"The sense of MYSTERY advertised by the Old Empire's marketing team has been distorting the reality of the mainstream media. This makes their customers believe that, whenever the Old Empire copies an ancient technology and rebrands it with their allegedly "creative" design hidden behind a series of mysterious teasers, quotes, and obscure hints scattered all over the place, they become the original inventor of the technology."

Chapter 9: A Special Treatment

(PERSONAL NOTE)

After listening to Airl's stupidly long rant, I began to believe that this alien may belong to one of those "Boomer" subspecies of the engineering race instead of the Millennials. His tendency to go on forever talking about his own "wisdom" gained from his boring old days annoyed the hell out of me. Since I was a professional recruiter, however, I made sure to keep smiling during the whole interview session whilst displaying a series of passive-aggressive gestures to let him realize that I don't care about his story at all.

Shortly after the first half of the interview, I submitted my transcript to the IT executives. They read it and were deeply annoyed by the fact that this alien even dared to express his own opinion. They immediately reported this act of offense to the CEO, who responded by saying that he will take control of the rest of the interview.

A few minutes later, the CEO entered the interview room and sat in front of Airl.

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)

CEO: "In case you don't know yet, our team is a group of open-minded innovators who think outside the box and are not afraid of questioning things. We value creativity and imagination, and encourage every individual to speak up, challenge the norm, and create impacts on our journey to make this world a better place. In order to see if you are a good fit, let me ask you one question. What is the most creative color?"

Airl: "Green."

CEO: "You are probably thinking that way because schools in your home planet taught you so. An open-minded, innovative individual would've said something that sounds more creative, like "magenta". But anyways, I will give you another chance to prove yourself that you are an active thinker and not the type of coder who sits on his desk all day long, only doing what he's told to do. Are you working on any open-source projects?"

Airl: "I do work on a project, although it is not open-source."

CEO: "Can you describe it to me?"

Airl: "It is a plan to destroy your planet."

CEO: "Ha, I got you!"

Chapter 10: Airl's Real Identity

(PERSONAL NOTE)

Everyone in the interview room was shocked to hear Airl's confession. Apparently, applying for a job was not even his primary goal. He was just living in California as an undercover code monkey, while secretly devising his plan to destroy planet Earth.

"So, this is your true identity! I knew it, I knew it the moment I saw you had balls to bring your flying saucer to my office building and occupied 5 parking spots at once without paying extra fees!" said the CEO.

"Oh, you humans are too quick to notice," said Airl. He opened up his jacket and revealed his waist belt, which was made up of a chain of coke and mentos bottles arranged in an alternating pattern.

"You ruined my plan. All I needed was to get an admin access to Boeing's GitHub repository to screw all your skyscrapers, after visiting the White House to publicly announce my will to annihilate your civilization," said the alien. Without hesitation, he pulled a colorful laser pistol out of his pocket and pressed one of its buttons. A series of crazy sound effects began to play, while the tip was emitting beams of rainbow.

"Kill him!" cried the CEO. A security officer pointed a Glock at Airl and fed his chest a couple of cone-shaped metal pieces, which the alien didn't seem to appreciate.

Airl suddenly grabbed my company laptop, made a couple of gymnastic movements to escape the interview room, and began to run towards his flying saucer which was parked right outside of the office. Another officer who was waiting in the parking lot saw him and pulled the plug out of the saucer's fuel tank to drain oil from it.

"Nice try, but mine is a hybrid model," chuckled Airl, leaping onto the top of the saucer.

"Quick! The alien is trying to steal our confidential tax info!" exclaimed the accountant, but it was too late. The alien's flying saucer already took off and swiftly zoomed through the air.

A split second later, a loud buzzing sound struck everyone's eardrums like a thunder. Electric poles near the parking lot tumbled over the grass whilst emitting brief sparks of high voltage. The flying saucer lost its velocity, crashed onto the ground, and burned. Apparently it crossed the power lines and was electrocuted.

CHAPTER 8: An Intellectual Challenge
--------------------------------------------------------

(Player and the girl spend the next few minutes following the dungeon's cavernous corridor.)

(Soon the corridor comes to an end. They find themselves entering a much broader cavern, in the middle of which is a table that has a circular hole on its top as well as a cylinder next to it whose cross section has the exact same size as the hole.)

Girl: "This is an extremely sophisticated puzzle that can only be solved by the smartest person in the world."

(The screen fades out and begins to display portraits of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and other famous historical figures. After quoting some of their most famous words in a deep masculine voice, the screen resumes back to the sight of the table.)

Girl: (Looking at the table), "One must solve this puzzle in order to unlock treasures that are hidden from us." (Kneeling down and starting to cry), "I am so sorry because I understand that you do not want to use your brain at any occasion because you are a gamer."

(A payment window appears on the screen. Its background is decorated with images of young women in swimming suits.)

Girl: (Sobbing), "Visa and Mastercard are also available options."

(Player clicks the payment button. After a brief moment, the cylinder slides itself through the table's circular hole. Fireworks and clapping sounds promptly burst out, letting the player know that he just solved the puzzle.)

(Camera zooms out and reveals the entire floor, which is now filled with glowing chests and rainbow-colored crystals.)

CHAPTER 9: Rewards
--------------------------------------------------------

(Camera slowly zooms back and navigates around the floor, closely examining fanfare animations of every one of the shiny treasures. An oversaturated pink chest starts to dance in front of the camera, while others are waiting in a queue preparing their own dance moves.)

Girl: (With a look of passionate delight), "Oh, you are the smartest man I have ever witnessed throughout my whole life!"

(The girl grabs her iPhone and starts texting.)

Girl: "I will invite my female friends to come and worship your supreme intelligence. You are the first person in history who figured out how to make a circular shape pass through a circular hole."

(The screen fades out of the upcoming scenery of random girls rushing toward the player, and begins to play a cinematic 3D animation of the cylinder passing through the table's circular hole. The video replays itself several times in slow motion, so as to ensure that the player did watch and understand it.)

(The video suddenly stops. A huge puff of smoke, created by a sudden explosion, briefly fills up the whole cavern. After several seconds, the smoke vanishes and reveals an old man who is wearing starry pajamas and long white beard. The ID card on his chest suggests that his name is: "Wise Old Man".)

Wise Old Man: (Pushing girls aside), "Everyone deserves love and peace. Stay safe, and don't let anything bad happen to you! Everyone's opinion is equally important, and we must save our planet!"

(He then disappears with a puff of smoke.)

Girl: (Facing the player), "He is a retired wizard who appears in random places and gives words of wisdom to everyone."

CHAPTER 10: An Important Part
--------------------------------------------------------

Girl: "Now, please let us lead you to the room next to this area."

(The girl points to a nearby door, which is labelled: "Dramatic Conversation Room".)

Girl: "We will go there and have a deep philosophical conversation, while breaking the fourth wall in a meta- sort of way. This will convince you that our game is made by creative artists whose names deserve to be recognized."

(A low-pitched buzzing sound bursts out in order to give the player a hint of dramatic revelation.)

(The door opens up, revealing a wide-open hall filled with pixelated portraits of the game's development team. The camera zooms into the hall and slowly looks around.)

Girl: (Pointing to the portrait in the middle), "This handsome man is the art director. He is a visionary who designed every single detail of this game, for he wanted to ensure that every one of his clueless team members will have an honor to spend the rest of their lifetime copying his stunningly innovative ideas."

(The girl hands over a piece of paper to the player, which is a copy of the art director's resume. The upper half of it is covered with a grayscale photo of him holding an enormous film camera while posing at the peak of a snowy mountain.)

(A browser window appears on the screen.)

(Browser Window): "Congratulations! We are offering you an honor to have an online conversation with the art director. Please click the link below to schedule a meeting, which will provide you with an opportunity to learn more about this extraordinary genius."
