<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 8: The Prison System</p>
<p>(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW CONTINUED)</p>
<p>Airl: "The heart of the Old Empire's prison system is a gigantic pyramid located at the center of their territory. This is the place to which every IS-BE is required to submit their daily work, which consists of full reimplementation of the same exact design concept that was slightly modified at the end of the previous day's last business hour. The top priest of the pyramid scans each IS-BE's code changes with his ankh, and makes sure that every design specification is satisfied to the utmost degree.</p>
<p>"This pyramid workflow was intentionally created as part of the IS-BE prison system. The pyramid is alleged to be the symbol for "professionalism". However, the "professionalism" of the Old Empire is intended to operate as part of the elaborate micromanagement "trap" consisting of MASS, MEANING, and MYSTERY.</p>
<p>"The colossal MASS of the pyramid gives an impression that this big-tech company is creating a large-scale community where everybody lives in harmony and works together as a team. Behind this grandiose facade of techno-utopia, however, the only real "community" is the power game being played among the Old Empire's shareholders.</p>
<p>"The MEANING behind the engineering standards of the pyramid is nothing more than a fabricated illusion. There is nothing meaningful about the particular services, plugins, or coding languages they insist on using; such nitpicky details are forced upon the IS-BEs not because those are fundamentally superior to other technical frameworks, but because their persistence helps secure the jobs of those who stayed in the pyramid long enough to memorize them all.</p>
<p>"The sense of MYSTERY advertised by the Old Empire's marketing team has been distorting the reality of the mainstream media. This makes their customers believe that, whenever the Old Empire copies an ancient technology and rebrands it with their allegedly "creative" design hidden behind a series of mysterious teasers, quotes, and obscure hints scattered all over the place, they become the original inventor of the technology."</p>
