OFFICIAL SCRIPT OF THE BEST-SELLING VIDEOGAME: "The Island of Infinite Treasures"
CHAPTER 1: Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------

(Intro music begins. A genderless gray humanoid suddenly appears in front of the player.)

Gray Humanoid: "Are you male or female?"

Player: "Male."

(The humanoid turns into a stunningly beautiful girl with blond hair.)

Girl: "Welcome to The Island of Infinite Treasures. As an NPC whose only purpose in life is to serve you as a loyal servant, I am thrilled to announce that you are the only hero in this universe who can save every one of us from acting out the most tragic-looking cinematic cutscene you will ever be able to watch in this game."

(Wind blows dramatically.)

Girl: "Since you are a gamer who was brave enough to squander a significant amount of money for a mere piece of entertainment, I am sure that you are not a fan of long intellectual conversations. So please let me skip all the subtle narratives and jump right into the most immediately fascinating part."

(Flashback begins. The girl frantically shakes her head in order to demonstrate the game's realistic hair physics.)

Girl: "Once upon a time..."

(A caption appears at the bottom of the screen. The girl hurriedly snatches it and dumps every one of its alphabets in a nearby recycling bin.)

Girl: "Oh, I'm sorry. I know you hate reading because you are a gamer. Please let me continue."

(The girl frantically shakes her head again, this time with a sparkling visual effect. The screen fades out and starts to display a dark mountain.)

CHAPTER 2: A Tragic Backstory
--------------------------------------------------------

Girl: "Once upon a time, there was an evil creature living on top of the mountain."

(Camera zooms towards the top of the dark mountain. A series of thunderstorms illuminate the whole mountaintop area, revealing a luxurious casino lounge hidden behind the dancing bushes.)

Girl: "This creature made enormous profits out of his own private casino."

(Camera zooms into the casino's interior, in the middle of which a nauseatingly ugly-looking monster is standing. He is smiling with the nastiest facial expression one can dare to envision, while holding a handful of golden coins and sniffing them voraciously.)

Girl: "This evil creature forced every visitor to give him a golden coin every time they wanted to play one of his slot machines. Can you imagine it? We only wanted to have some fun, yet he ruined it by making us pay for it."

(The girl begins to sob. A sad violin piece aids her heartbreaking expression of sorrow.)

Girl: "He even dared to put an advertisement of his casino at the center of the island's largest shore, ruining the view of this beautiful island."

(The girl sobs louder. Music intensifies.)

Girl: "This is the reason why we need you. You are the CHOSEN ONE. You are the only hero in this island who can save the world by defeating this heartless lifeform who stole everything from us. Once you kill him and dissect his belly, all the treasures he had swallowed will come out and make us wealthy again. We will honor you with the fanciest-looking visual effects we can afford to display!"

(Camera zooms out. The flashback ends by displaying photos of children who are starving because the evil creature didn't donate his money to charity.)

CHAPTER 3: The Chosen One
--------------------------------------------------------

(The girl opens up her handbag and reveals a trophy, which she hands over to the player while bowing down as politely as possible.)

Girl: "Here, please take this trophy. You saved our developers right before the moment of death from starvation, by paying 10 bucks to purchase this game. Your heroic act will never be forgotten, and in order to commemorate this historical event we decided to raise a golden statue of yours."

(The girl points to the nearby plaza, upon which the player's gigantic golden face shines like the Sun.)

Girl: "You are this island's last hope. You are the only one who can save all of us by killing the evil creature. Please press any key to continue!"

(Several seconds elapse without a key press.)

Girl: "... Since you are a gamer, I might have overestimated your attention span. So please let me reiterate this story in a more concise manner."

(The girl pulls out an iPad from her handbag, upon which a short phrase is written in bold uppercase letters. The girl reads them out loud, while pointing each individual letter with a red stick equipped with a pulsating LED light.)

Girl: "KILL- ENEMY! GET- REWARDS!"

(Player finally figures out where the "any" key is located on his keyboard and presses it. The girl starts to clap, dance, and surrounds herself with colorful fireworks for the purpose of celebrating the player's ability to comprehend the game's incredibly sophisticated narratives.)

(Popup Message): "Achievement unlocked - You know how to follow a storyline!"

CHAPTER 4: The Journey Begins
--------------------------------------------------------

(Camera zooms out. An infinitely wide sandbox appears in front of them.)

Girl: "This is an open-world game furnished with endless possibilities. Please feel free to explore, be yourself, and don't be afraid to be creative. I am so excited to see all sorts of amazing creations you are going to come up with, while you are travelling!"

(Player spends the next 4 hours walking across the sandbox.)

(Popup Message): "Achievement unlocked - You know how to walk!"

(After the period of fully immersive next-generation gaming experience, the player and the girl finally find themselves in front of a castle's entrance.)

Girl: "This is where your journey truly begins. Before entering this home of adventure, please let me show you a cutscene which..."

(Player skips the cutscene. The girl immediately puts her DVD player back inside her handbag and opens up the castle's entrance door.)

(Camera cinematically enters the castle and slowly rotates to reveal its main lobby. The lobby's inner walls are studded with gigantic oriental-looking red dragons as well as a cartoon painting of a chopstick warrior wearing a cone-shaped hat.)

Girl: "Please take a look at this place and admire its diversity. We are so thrilled to show you how open-minded our developers are."

(Camera follows the staircase and enters the second floor's toilet room.)

Girl: "If you happen to visit this castle's toilet while looking for Easter eggs, please don't be alarmed if the toilet seat flushes itself with pink squares instead of water. Our development team's full-time toilet VFX artist just quit his job a week before the game's release, and we had no time to buy a spare artist."

CHAPTER 5: The Warrior
--------------------------------------------------------

(Player and the girl walk upstairs and enter a closet room. A shiny knight armor reveals itself in front of them.)

Girl: "Please allow me to have an honor to dress you up with my hands. Manual labor is reserved for unworthy peasants like me. A rich, highly educated gentleman like you, who graciously spent 10 bucks to purchase this game, should not be compelled to move his finger an inch."

(A sequence of mildly suggestive animations play out, each of which is carefully designed not to let the game be rated something other than "E".)

(Popup Message): "Achievement unlocked - You found out where the closet room is!"

(Shiny beams of light emanate from all over the player, who is now fully dressed up. His hair turns blond.)

Girl: "You are now a mighty warrior, the only hero in the universe who can handle this special weapon I'm going to show you."

(The girl points at the nearby pedestal, upon which a shiny credit card is laying majestically. Camera zooms in, revealing the phrase: "Legendary Membership" written on its front side.)

Girl: "This enchanted credit card will equip you with the ability to afford anything you want, with additional savings and other unlimited benefits. All you need to do is just swipe it!"

(Player puts his hand upon the card. A dramatic whirlwind surrounds the player and emits vivid sparkles of light, creating a visual proof that this credit card is not being forced to be owned by the player without a consent.)

(Player makes a swiping gesture with the card. Without hesitation, a truckload of cookies appear out of thin air and pile up before the player.)

CHAPTER 6: The First Dungeon
--------------------------------------------------------

(The girl cheers at the pile of cookies. She starts grouping them by dozens and putting them in sandwich bags.)

Girl: "Great job! You just unleashed your hidden potentials. Swipe it as many times as you want!"

(Player swipes the credit card multiple times in rapid succession, flooding the entire castle with cookies. Some cookies begin to disappear for the purpose of keeping the game's framerate above 30.)

(Popup Message): "Achievement unlocked - You just won our premium reward membership-"

(Player turns off popup notification.)

Girl: "Now that you have limitless power on your hand, you are ready to begin your heroic journey. Please follow me; I will lead your way to the dungeon."

(The girl pushes the closet aside and reveals an elevator door. The word "Tutorial Dungeon" is shown on the elevator's floor display.)

(The girl presses the elevator's call button with the most femininely suggestive demeanor that the animator could possibly wrap his naughty head around to devise. For the fear of overestimating the average gamer's attention span, the elevator skyrockets right up to the closet's floor within a split second and signals its arrival with a loud ringing noise. The elevator door opens.)

Girl: "This ancient relic was hidden for thousands of years, which revealed its existence only an hour before you arrived here. This means the whole universe has been waiting for you."

(Player and the girl walk inside the elevator. As soon as the door shuts down, the elevator rapidly plunges down and arrives at one of the commercial dungeons located on floor B5.)

CHAPTER 7: Something Not So Mainstream
--------------------------------------------------------

(As soon as they enter the dungeon's reception room, the girl kneels on the carpet and kisses the player's hand with a light bow.)

Girl: "As a clueless NPC, I have been awaiting for a master like you whom I could depend my life on. I will never forget those 10 bucks you have so generously handed over to us. And because of this, I owe you every bit of obedience my heart can ever commit to offer."

(The girl, still kneeling down, opens her handbag and hands over another trophy to the player. The phrase "Participation Award" is engraved on its lid.)

Girl: "This is a small gift of gratitude we have decided to have an honor to present you. No word would be rich enough to depict the incredible level of patience you have been showing us by still playing this game without immediately visiting Steam to post a negative review."

(The girl suddenly blushes her face and bursts into tears of joy.)

Girl: "You are a man of great virtue, who-"

(Player skips the monologue.)

Girl: (Standing up), "Thank you for allowing us to share your social security number."

(Suddenly the camera shakes itself violently and tilts in an awkward angle. Its point of focus shifts from here to there, creating a grotesque sense of vertigo.)

(A ghastly figurine, which resembles a completely random concoction of creepy-looking dolls and toy parts, appears out of nowhere and screams like a mad cat. It then disappears and the camera resumes its normal state.)

Girl: "Oh, I'm sorry if you are confused. It was a mysterious foreshadowing element intended to convince you that this game is hiding a profound secret which you will miss and regret if you stop playing."

CHAPTER 8: An Intellectual Challenge
--------------------------------------------------------

(Player and the girl spend the next few minutes following the dungeon's cavernous corridor.)

(Soon the corridor comes to an end. They find themselves entering a much broader cavern, in the middle of which is a table that has a circular hole on its top as well as a cylinder next to it whose cross section has the exact same size as the hole.)

Girl: "This is an extremely sophisticated puzzle that can only be solved by the smartest person in the world."

(The screen fades out and begins to display portraits of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and other famous historical figures. After quoting some of their most famous words in a deep masculine voice, the screen resumes back to the sight of the table.)

Girl: (Looking at the table), "One must solve this puzzle in order to unlock treasures that are hidden from us." (Kneeling down and starting to cry), "I am so sorry because I understand that you do not want to use your brain at any occasion because you are a gamer."

(A payment window appears on the screen. Its background is decorated with images of young women in swimming suits.)

Girl: (Sobbing), "Visa and Mastercard are also available options."

(Player clicks the payment button. After a brief moment, the cylinder slides itself through the table's circular hole. Fireworks and clapping sounds promptly burst out, letting the player know that he just solved the puzzle.)

(Camera zooms out and reveals the entire floor, which is now filled with glowing chests and rainbow-colored crystals.)

CHAPTER 9: Rewards
--------------------------------------------------------

(Camera slowly zooms back and navigates around the floor, closely examining fanfare animations of every one of the shiny treasures. An oversaturated pink chest starts to dance in front of the camera, while others are waiting in a queue preparing their own dance moves.)

Girl: (With a look of passionate delight), "Oh, you are the smartest man I have ever witnessed throughout my whole life!"

(The girl grabs her iPhone and starts texting.)

Girl: "I will invite my female friends to come and worship your supreme intelligence. You are the first person in history who figured out how to make a circular shape pass through a circular hole."

(The screen fades out of the upcoming scenery of random girls rushing toward the player, and begins to play a cinematic 3D animation of the cylinder passing through the table's circular hole. The video replays itself several times in slow motion, so as to ensure that the player did watch and understand it.)

(The video suddenly stops. A huge puff of smoke, created by a sudden explosion, briefly fills up the whole cavern. After several seconds, the smoke vanishes and reveals an old man who is wearing starry pajamas and long white beard. The ID card on his chest suggests that his name is: "Wise Old Man".)

Wise Old Man: (Pushing girls aside), "Everyone deserves love and peace. Stay safe, and don't let anything bad happen to you! Everyone's opinion is equally important, and we must save our planet!"

(He then disappears with a puff of smoke.)

Girl: (Facing the player), "He is a retired wizard who appears in random places and gives words of wisdom to everyone."

CHAPTER 10: An Important Part
--------------------------------------------------------

Girl: "Now, please let us lead you to the room next to this area."

(The girl points to a nearby door, which is labelled: "Dramatic Conversation Room".)

Girl: "We will go there and have a deep philosophical conversation, while breaking the fourth wall in a meta- sort of way. This will convince you that our game is made by creative artists whose names deserve to be recognized."

(A low-pitched buzzing sound bursts out in order to give the player a hint of dramatic revelation.)

(The door opens up, revealing a wide-open hall filled with pixelated portraits of the game's development team. The camera zooms into the hall and slowly looks around.)

Girl: (Pointing to the portrait in the middle), "This handsome man is the art director. He is a visionary who designed every single detail of this game, for he wanted to ensure that every one of his clueless team members will have an honor to spend the rest of their lifetime copying his stunningly innovative ideas."

(The girl hands over a piece of paper to the player, which is a copy of the art director's resume. The upper half of it is covered with a grayscale photo of him holding an enormous film camera while posing at the peak of a snowy mountain.)

(A browser window appears on the screen.)

(Browser Window): "Congratulations! We are offering you an honor to have an online conversation with the art director. Please click the link below to schedule a meeting, which will provide you with an opportunity to learn more about this extraordinary genius."
