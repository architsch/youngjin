<h1>Abacus Engineer</h1>
<p class="dim">Author: Youngjin Kang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date: November 20, 2023</p>
<p>Just because you own an abacus doesn't mean you are a real abacus engineer.</p>
<p>It's an unpopular opinion, but as an industry veteran with more than 30 years of experience, I've got to say this.</p>
<p>Not every abacus engineer is equal. Some of them will be obsolete soon because they don't understand the basic principles.</p>
<p>Here's why.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ A junior abacus engineer knows that facing his abacus to the South and his teapot to the East is the only correct way of calculating numbers.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ A mid-senior abacus engineer knows that a round-edged titanium abacus is the only professional tool that can ensure the integrity of the product.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ A senior abacus engineer knows that having a tea ceremony as a team is more important than brewing tea on his own.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ A principal abacus engineer knows that serving tea with the right hand while handling the abacus with the left hand is the only way to ensure customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>If you want to become a 10x engineer, you must keep all these in mind.</p>
