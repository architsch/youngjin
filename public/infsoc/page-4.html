<h1>ChatGPT Can't Replace Me</h1>
<p class="dim">Author: Youngjin Kang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date: November 22, 2023</p>
<p>😡 As a professional salesperson, I'm totally enraged by people who are saying that ChatGPT will replace my job.</p>
<p>ChatGPT will NEVER replace my job! PERIOD. 👏👏👏</p>
<p>Do you want to know why?</p>
<p>Here are the reasons. 👀</p>
<p>🙌 ChatGPT doesn't try to fulfill the integrity of the product by actively participating in customer satisfaction and maximizing profit by leveraging our latest cutting-edge technologies pioneered by our top industry veterans who have decades of experience using SaaS to get the most out of customer engagement and building next-gen SEO by means of creative technological innovations and decentralized monetization strategies designed to stay in tune with our leading IT experts.</p>
<p>🙌 ChatGPT doesn't consult our top professionals with cutting-edge industry experiences across multiple disciplines in order to come up with our next-gen B2B solutions which will let your team share their visions of IoT on top of distributed platforms and build their own fully sustainable and innovative open-source community with as little friction as possible by actively creating values and optimizing your brand's storytelling strategies which will maximize the integrity of your dream of customer engagement.</p>
<p>🙌 ChatGPT doesn't know how to ensure the integrity of your brand values by sharing your creative game-changing visions of our bright future roadmap with our top-tier industry professionals who will bring the most innovative and groundbreaking ideas to build our community of passionate team players whose mission is to deliver humanitarian values across the globe and save our planet with the help of bright, young, talented people who support active collaboration of diverse individuals across all industries. 🙏</p>
<p>As you can see, my writing is absolutely original and no chatbot can imitate me.</p>
