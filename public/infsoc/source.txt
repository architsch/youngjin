[Photography is the Future] November 19, 2023

If you don't learn how to take a photo, you are falling behind!

Top professionals in the art industry all agree that PHOTOGRAPHY, our new cutting-edge technology which will revolutionize our way of being creative, will completely replace traditional artists in just a few years.

You will never survive as an artist if you don't learn about photography.

Here is why.

👏 Painting is dead. No matter how realistic it gets, it will never be as realistic as a photo.

👏 A camera can do everything that a senior painter with decades of experience can do.

👏 Any creative individual can use a camera to generate a stunning masterpiece, without having to learn any of the complicated drawing skills.

👏 Companies are already starting to hire photographers instead of painters for their creative work.

In order to find out how to join this new revolution, check out my latest book: "How to Master Photography in 5 Days".

[Response to "Photography is the Future"] November 19, 2023

Photography will never replace real artists. A camera takes an hour of exposure to make a photo, whereas a skilled painter can quickly draw the same thing in just a few minutes. No matter how hard machines try, they will never outsmart human ingenuity. Checkmate!

[Abacus Engineer] November 20, 2023

Just because you own an abacus doesn't mean you are a real abacus engineer.

It's an unpopular opinion, but as an industry veteran with more than 30 years of experience, I've got to say this.

Not every abacus engineer is equal. Some of them will be obsolete soon because they don't understand the basic principles.

Here's why.

👉 A junior abacus engineer knows that facing his abacus to the South and his teapot to the East is the only correct way of calculating numbers.

👉 A mid-senior abacus engineer knows that a round-edged titanium abacus is the only professional tool that can ensure the integrity of the product.

👉 A senior abacus engineer knows that having a tea ceremony as a team is more important than brewing tea on his own.

👉 A principal abacus engineer knows that serving tea with the right hand while handling the abacus with the left hand is the only way to ensure customer satisfaction.

If you want to become a 10x engineer, you must keep all these in mind.
