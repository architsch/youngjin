[Designing a Software Product] January 21, 2025 - February 28, 2025

This is a collection of my personal thoughts on the design of a software product.

@@<hr>
<001>
@@<h3><b>1. Where to Begin</b></h3>

Imagine that you are trying to design a software product. Depending on your field of interest, it could be a game, a social networking service, a chatbot, an educational platform, or something else.

No matter what type of product you have in mind, however, we can all agree that it ought to be something meaningful. And by "meaningful", I mean a set of qualitative measures which transcend a mere assortment of dry, mechanistic details.

When designing a software, it is necessary to resolve a gap between the product's end goal and its implementation details. We can surmount this difficulty via quantitative reasoning.

For example, suppose that we are trying to create a pet simulator (similar to Tamagotchi). What shall we do to fulfill such an objective?

First, we need to devise a list of meaningful pet-related experiences. In addition, we need to figure out how to translate them into computational procedures (because they must be part of a computer program).

We can achieve this by defining our pet simulator not in terms of vague emotional descriptions, but in terms of numerical quantities.

@@<hr>
<002>
@@<h3><b>2. Quantification of Meaning</b></h3>

The question is, what kinds of numerical quantities do we want in our pet simulator?

This is where the problem of ambiguity arises. Overcoming this initial barrier is crucial for the sake of designing something meaningful.

To kick-start the design process, let me come up with a couple of ideas. The very first thing which crosses my mind is that the pet needs food to survive.

Whenever the pet eats something, its energy level increases. If it doesn't eat anything, its energy level will gradually drop.

What comes next? Let me guess. Note that food is not the only biological need. For example, the pet also needs to be caressed to feel that it is being loved.

For prototyping purposes, then, it will be sensible to add a pair of buttons to let us interact with the pet - one for feeding, and the other one for caressing. Clicking the former will increase the energy level, while clicking the latter will increase the affection level.

Here, we can see an example of a dilemma between two choices. While we are feeding the pet, it cannot be caressed. And while we are caressing the pet, it cannot be fed.

@@<hr>
<003>
@@<h3><b>3. The Geometry of Variables</b></h3>

The design of a virtual pet, then, can be summarized as the following two steps:

(1) Create a set of variables, each of which represents a unique aspect of the pet's state.
(2) Create a set of actions, which either increment or decrement these variables when invoked.

The act of feeding, for instance, may greatly amplify the pet's energy level but slightly reduce its affection level. The act of caressing, on the other hand, may greatly amplify the pet's affection level but slightly reduce its energy level.

And if we spend time without doing anything, both the pet's energy and affection levels can be expected to decay as time passes by.

The dynamics of pet simulation can be easily visualized. For example, we can treat the pet's current state as a particle on a 2D plane, whose axes denote the pet's energy and affection levels, respectively.

Each action, then, will be interpreted as a force which pushes the particle in a specific direction.

@@<hr>
<004>
@@<h3><b>4. Multiple Agents</b></h3>

So, it looks like introducing a few variables and means of manipulating them will let us create a simple pet simulator.

This solution, however, is restrictive in the sense that it does not scale. If we are to stick solely to the idea of raising a single pet, the horizon of our experience will forever be constrained to that of a cheap electronic toy, such as Tamagotchi.

There is a way to overcome such a barrier, though. All we have to do is provide the user with multiple pets instead of just one. This will open up a door to a richer spectrum of choices, without necessitating us to invent anything new.

From a game design point of view, such a means of scaling introduces the notion of progression. By adding more and more pets to the inventory, the user is now able to participate in a mission towards continual improvement.

This is an indispensable feature to have, as it is necessary to ensure that the user won't run out of goals to pursue.

@@<hr>
<005>
@@<h3><b>5. Relations</b></h3>

Previously, we saw that letting the user own multiple pets (instead of just one) neatly solves the scaling issue.

If pets are unable to interact with each other, however, the overall experience will be too flat and boring.

One way to solve this is to invent a variable which describes not just a single pet, but a relationship between two pets.

For example, we may come up with a new variable which represents the degree of jealousy that a pet feels towards another pet. We will then be able to declare a rule such as: "Pet A becomes more jealous towards pet B whenever the user caresses B in front of A".

The main benefit of this is that it introduces a wide variety of dynamic behaviors to the system. Too much jealousy, for instance, may trigger a pet to start a fight with another pet, resulting in mutual damage.

Such a conflict of interests serves as an important factor in the design of subtle narratives. It urges the user to make choices carefully, since each choice may incur a catastrophic side effect.

@@<hr>
<006>
@@<h3><b>6. Partitioning</b></h3>

We may imagine a pet simulator as a network of pets and their relationships.

If every pet is capable of interacting with every other pet at any given moment, however, the whole system will plunge into chaos.

The most effective solution to this is to partition our simulation space into rooms that are separate from each other, meaning that pets in one room won't be able to interact with those in another room.

Such a mechanic allows us to create local environments, each of which is imbued with its own personality. It also provides the user with an extra dimension of self inquiry, such as: "Should I put these two pets in the same room? They might fight with each other."

Another advantage is that it makes things more digestible. By splitting a large herd of pets into isolated groups, the user is now only required to pay attention to a handful of them at a time, rather than having to monitor the entire community of pets like an omniscient deity.

@@<hr>
<007>
@@<h3><b>7. Modes of Interaction</b></h3>

The richness of user experience can be further amplified by splitting it into multiple channels.

In our pet simulator, for example, the user might be allowed to not only take care of one's pets, but also send them to schools, consult a vet, visit a local pet shop, and so on. Since these activities differ from each other significantly, we may assume that they belong to separate classes.

The overall structure of the UI, then, could be depicted as a list of global menu options. Each of them, when clicked, will bring the user to a distinct local space, equipped with its own category of user interactions.

The exact layout of this sort of UI may vary, of course, depending on what kind of product it is intending to convey.

What is noteworthy, though, is the fact that it prevents confusion by neatly segmenting the system into specialized modules, each of which focuses on its own topic and nothing else.

@@<hr>
<008>
@@<h3><b>8. UI State VS System State</b></h3>

When we think about a software product as a state machine (as in automata theory), we quickly come to the conclusion that it consists of two distinct types of state - one which is bound to user interaction (aka "UI State"), and the other one which is bound to the system's internal dynamics (aka "System State").

The UI state mirrors the way in which the user is currently interacting with the app's virtual world. The dimensions of the viewport (i.e. camera), the position of the page's scollbar, the current menu selection, and the like, are all parts of the application's UI state. They do not directly influence things that are happening in the world.

The System state, on the other hand, refers to the current state of the world itself. In our pet simulator, for example, the individual pets' positions and energy/affection levels should all be taken as parts of the application's System state because they all contribute to what is happening inside the world.

@@<hr>
<009>
@@<h3><b>9. State Hierarchy</b></h3>

A software product, regardless of its kind, possesses its own state. An important concept to keep in mind is that the state itself may be broken down to smaller states, each of which can then be broken down to even smaller states, and so on.

Eventually, this sort of breakdown reveals its own hierarchical structure.

Based on this kind of reasoning, we can easily design the entire tree of states from a top-down perspective. All we need to do is first define a few general state objects, and then describe each of them as a collection of more specific state objects, and so forth.

What is interesting is that there are direct one-to-one mappings between states which are equivalent but designed to serve different purposes.

The state of the UI which displays the current hunger level of a virtual pet, for instance, could be bound to reflect the actual hunger level of the pet to which it corresponds. This is an example of "UI binding" - a recurring concept in the domain of reactive programming.

A doll is a special object. It is inanimate from a functional point of view, yet it is nevertheless endowed with the appearances of an animate being. In a way, therefore, a doll plays the role of a mediator between the realm of life (spirits) and the realm of death.

A doll is a piece of dead matter which is given its own spirit. The spirit lets the doll come alive as its own quasi-living thing. The act of fabricating a doll and giving it a name (identity), therefore, tears the boundary between the overworld and the underworld, giving birth to a "middle region" in which both the live and dead come together and establish a meaningful symbiosis. This place is an intersection between soul and matter.

Dolls can be found in a variety of forms in today's free market. A consumer good, for instance, is a doll which is imbued with the brand's spirit. Some people choose to buy goods of a specific brand because they assign metaphysical meanings to it, other than the pragmatic implication of the product's mere material composition.

Shopping, therefore, could be imagined as a process of furnishing one's own inventory of dolls - an intricate collection of enchanted icons, ready to connect the consumer's identity to the edge of reality where the distinction between the real and unreal blurs itself.

A treasure box is full of hidden wonders. The moment you open it up, it may present you with either a pleasant surprise (reward) or punishment. It is a box of mystery, and you never know what kind of thing will reveal itself until you decide to open it.

The core mechanic of a treasure box is random reward, driven by the principle of uncertainty. The act of disclosing it brings you either a good luck or bad luck, and such an outcome is determined by pure chance and not by your personal will. It is a game of randomness.

This hypothetical box shows up in different forms across a variety of cases. In the context of mining, it could be a chunk of dirt and stone beyond which precious minerals might be hidden. In the context of fishing, it could be an opaque pond in which you might be able to catch a fish. And in the context of gambling, you could imagine it as a slot machine.

In every one of the aforementioned scenarios, though, the essence of what constitutes a treasure box stays the same. It is basically an "enclosure of a secret" - a nutshell, when cracked open, throws you upon an unexpected line of destiny. And the way to open it usually involves just a simple kind of action, such as digging the ground with a pickaxe, casting a fishing rod, or pulling the lever of a slot machine.

A portal is a gateway to another world - a special device of magic which lets the user "cross the threshold" to the other side of reality. It is an awkward puncture in the midst of our mundane everyday life. In literature as well as popular media, it serves as a means of scene transition.

An adventure usually begins by entering a portal, which is typically concealed in a long neglected corner of a place. It could be a door, a looking glass, a closet, an elevator, a storm, or any other "hole" in physical dimension which is capable of temporarily splitting the continuum of our living space into two binary regions - "here" (i.e. the world with which we are familiar) and "there" (i.e. the world which is unknown and full of mysteries).

By crossing a portal, one faces a major shift in one's life due to the sudden disappearance of friendly elements from one's environment. The other side of the portal presents the visitor with a whole new spectrum of paradigms, most of which defy the expectations of one's prior knowledge and education.

A portal opens up a door to a whole new space of possibilities and exploration. In a way, therefore, it provides us with inexplicable catharsis - a sense of spiritual liberation from the confines of ordinary life. In the prolonged absence of such a portal, we usually fabricate one by planning a travel, engaging in an unusual outdoor activity, or studying an unfamiliar subject.

A furnace is a melting pot of chaotic rigmaroles. It is a crucible governed by primordial fire, which disassembles the well-established structure of its ingredients and concocts their inner organs into a bizarrely morphed form. It is a place of rebirth - a transformation from one state to another.

What would a furnace signify from a functional standpoint? There could be many interpretations, but one thing which is worthy of remark is that it allows multiple elements to come together and fuse into a whole separate entity. Thus, we can imagine that a furnace is a cradle of interactions and their unforeseen consequences.

One of the key takeaways of such synthesis is the very notion of unexpectedness. Familiar elements, when combined, sometimes merge into a surprising result which may either bless or destroy the creator. This queer sort of jumpscare, emerging off of the middle of one's otherwise ordinary experience, introduces a sudden "turn" in our familiar storyline, thereby reshaping the perfectly logic-driven clockwork universe into one which is interleaved with caverns of lurking chaos.

Light is an essential ingredient of visibility. We need it in order to observe our surroundings, gather information, and draw a picture of where we are and what kinds of things wait before us. Its presence ensures the overcoming of darkness - an indispensable precondition of knowledge.

It is our instinct to struggle to learn more and more about the environment in which we live. And the root of such an innate tendency can be traced back to the evolutionary fact that the more we know, the more likely we will manage to survive in this hostile world which is full of hidden dangers.

This also explains why darkness is a common element of horror in literature, as well as other forms of media such as films, games, etc. Fear originates from the unknown, and the lack of one's capacity to explain things that are happening nearby. By covering our eyes with the veil of ignorance, darkness renders us vulnerable against the phantasmagoria of potential threats.

The very moment we turn on a source of light, this chamber of uncertainty dissolves itself into oblivion and lets us surmount the unfounded fear which has been haunting us. Light, therefore, is a symbol of courage, grounded upon the promise that everything is and will stay lit in our field of vision.

Everyone longs to discover the ultimate purpose in life. Everyone searches for a direction whenever a mist of uncertainty surrounds them. And whenever such a sentiment is being recognized, a spiritual guidance comes into play and saves the day.

A compass is what we need whenever we are lost in the thin air of motivational void. Being a direction-provider, a compass often symbolizes our hope for a parental figure who will lead us to a sequence of persistent goals as well as means to achieve them.

A compass gives us a sense of purpose - a belief that the peak of the mountain to which it is pointing is somewhere worth reaching. It gives us a reason to stay alive and continually strive to become a better version of ourselves every morning, for the hope of getting closer and closer to our ideal destination. It is what endows even the most trivial of our actions with its own meaning.

It can also be understood that a compass only provides us with a fragmentary view of a more holistic vision, which is represented by a map. A map is an overall outline (i.e. a bigger picture) of a panorama of goals that are waiting to be accomplished and how they should be approached. Since such a map can be too complex to read, however, a compass is often preferred when it comes to helping the user focus on one goal at a time, on a step-by-step basis.

A fountain is a source of life. It is the ultimate birthplace where everything comes into existence, by means of its unrestricted supply of water. Through its life-giving agency, a fountain provides the world with seeds of fertility which will eventually grow into a jungle of living matters.

Such a place of initial creation is an indispensable element to have in a narrative universe, which promises to begin its genealogy of events with its own story.

A universe, filled with its own system of meaningful causes and their correspondingly meaningful consequences, must start by telling a story at some point in time. And in order to do that, it needs to have a point of origin - the place where the hero's journey begins, the evil of the world unveils, and the ensemble of earthly matters sprout and fill up the void of space, ready to unfold their secrets before the eyes of the adventurer.

In a static, desert-like environment, we can easily imagine such a place of origin as a fountain. Once we introduce water to dry land, life starts to grow and populate its silent horizons. This is the moment at which dynamism comes into play and transforms the land into a colossal "engine" of the storyline, which henceforth drives the pangs and joys of the drama and the way they relate themselves with one another.

Building blocks make up the essence of our creative freedom. They are the very flesh and bones of which the landscape of our living area is made. By means of building blocks, we are able to devise all sorts of architectural wonders each of which may be imbued with its own practical and/or aesthetic features.

While the most basic building blocks are purely structural (i.e. They are static and idle objects which do not actively interact with their surroundings), we may also discover dynamic ones which are capable of displaying their own characteristic behaviors when exposed to certain conditions. An automatic door, for instance, will open itself up whenever somebody comes in front of it.

In a way, therefore, building blocks serve as the core components of the world and its dynamic system. Their particular arrangement may trigger the emergence of a series of particular events, which in turn may modify the original arrangement which triggered those events in the first place. Such a cyclic pattern of interaction signals the birth of an emergent system, which evolves over time by means of a recurring feedback loop and self-adaptation.

There are multiple universes in our mental landscape. As imaginative beings, we all possess "bubbles" of ideas within the deep waters of our psychic realm. Each of these bubbles is a fictional world, governed by its own laws of nature and populated by its own families of both animate and inanimate entities.

A cabinet of curiosities, which is an assortment of scientific wonders gathered from the nature, is a symbol of such a fictional universe which serves as a fuel for one's creative endeavors. As there are multiple cabinets across different rooms and buildings, a person, too, carries an entire museum of miniature universes in one's mind.

Some of these inner spheres of imagination might be collective in nature, meaning that many of us share significant portions of them as part of our culture. If you and I have read the same fantasy novel, for example, we would be sharing more or less the same world which is being depicted by that novel.

Popular media, as well as their myriad genres of entertainment, comprise a dense network of imaginary spaces, each of which possesses its own share of virtual citizens including fans, critics, and other types of audiences. Depending on how the media's narratives unfold, such spaces may freely merge, split, grow, or shrink as time passes by, as though they are celestial bodies in outerspace.

Unlike a small neighborhood in which you are honored as an irreplaceable member of the community, a city is an unfathomably gigantic, cold, inhuman vacuum in which you will hardly find a home.

A busy metropolitan city is a center of prosperity. However, it is also a place in which individuality is utterly crushed under the weight of the populace. The city's densely populated urban areas are full of cheap, dispensable workers, constantly being told that they are nothing more than mere lines on a chart, ready to be erased the moment they are deemed useless.

Therefore, it is not hard to understand why so many forms of contemporary media, including novels, games, and films, often depict the city as the ultimate enemy of mankind in today's world.

A hero in our modern life is no longer a muscular warrior who fights in a battlefield or partakes in a journey to the wilderness. Instead, it is the kind of individual who is meek yet not afraid to build a kingdom of infinite space in the midst of this shallow, crowded world - someone who possesses a courage to stand up against the city's bloodless apathy and its callous breath to wipe everybody's dignity out of existence.

The power of a word is immeasurable. A word is a point of intersection between the material and psychic realms, serving as an interface via which feelings can be transmitted. Whenever you say a word, you are breathing a portion of your soul into that word, turning it into a carrier of a spirit.

A spirit might be thought of as a "piece of information" from a scientific standpoint. It means that we should consider a word as a volume in space which is able to be possessed by a spirit, and remain so as long as it stays legible.

By means of words, we share our spirits with those who decide to read them. And the swiftness of such a process is determined by how vividly each word depicts its corresponding spirit, as well as how compatible it is with the reader's system of thoughts.

In this sense, a computer may be imagined as a "spirit-processing machine" which inhales a stream of words (i.e. commands), rearranges their spirits according to rules established by their friends living in the motherboard's psychic ecosystem, and exhales a modified stream of words.

In popular forms of media such as video games, therefore, words are being used as basic building blocks out of which ghosts of meaning come out, reveal themselves through the silhouette of the stage's veiling curtain, and greet their audiences.

A phantom is an inevitable byproduct of melancholy. It summons itself in the midst of one's illusion of hope, just to vanish all of a sudden and leave the observer dumbfounded in a cage of profound sorrow. It is the last summer night's dream, always missed but never grasped.

A phantom is usually a wicked reminder of one's foregone days which, like a late spring's cherry blossoms, had fallen down to the irreversible pit of time. They are unretrieved fragments of our missing past.

Today's media, including music videos, games, dramas, and the like, often hint the presence of such nostalgic illusion in the form of a magical enchantment, which erupts from a toybox of supernatural forces and rapidly dissolves back to thin air as soon as its charmful aura wears off.

A typical fairytale in today's world, for example, begins with a train of delightful gifts which soon get taken away at random moments in time (as though they were mere puffs of one's daydream). Images of fantastic creatures appear and disappear in irregular succession, never staying in fixed places.

In a way, therefore, phantoms reflect the inner anxiety of modern life in which people have lost their permanent identities and have become wanderers in the ocean of information superhighways. In this era of spiritual desolation, one has no choice but take refuge in glorious snapshots of one's past - those good old days back when things were simpler and had solid meanings.

[Dead Words] March 23, 2025

<010>

When it comes to communicating with other people, we often face difficulties with regard to the effectiveness of the words we use.

For instance, when I say the word, "epistemology", what do you envision in your mind? If you are an academic person, you will probably be able to imagine its meaning in terms of academic papers you've read as well as their abstract narratives and cross-references.

The vast majority of other people, however, do not share the same level of knowledge which you may happen to have in your mind. Without a sufficient degree of background information in the context of philosophy, one simply cannot comprehend the meaning of the word "epistemology" without taking great pains investigating its origin.

The same goes with other abstract terminologies. Words such as "matrix", "vector", "derivative", or "predicate", can only be understood by those who have been acquainted with the study of mathematics. In the same vein, words such as "faith", "salvation", "sin", or "redemption", can only be accurately grasped by those who have at least studied the basic concepts in theology.

The problem is that no one knows everything, and that each person is only familiar with a tiny fraction of what the world knows as a whole. This sort of limitation renders it difficult for a musician to understand an accountant, a soldier to understand a poet, and a monk to understand a lawyer.

As a result, we are living in an inexplicably fragmented world, where everyone is speaking their own language. Cliques of like-minded experts lock themselves up in their impenetrable ivory towers, and refuse to communicate with the rest of the world.

What gave birth to this pandemic of mutual isolation? In my opinion, it all began with the sophistry of human mind and its tendency to use words that are dead rather than alive. What I mean by this will become clear in the example below.

If I say words such as "postmodernism", "teleology", or "substantialism", it will be hard for most readers to picture them in their minds. And the reason behind this is pretty straightforward. These academic terms are so abstract in nature, that they do not have tangible counterparts in our imagination. For example, we cannot imagine "postmodernism" as an object in space, with its own shape, color, sound, or smell. Since this word refers to a formless idea which is not directly associated with anything we can perceive, we are unable to sense it without taking circumventory measures (such as recalling a book in which we saw the word "postmodernism", or recalling the face of somebody who has spoken the word "postmodernism", and so on).

Therefore, abstract words such as the ones I just mentioned can be considered dead. They are "dead" in the sense that they do not have images which are vividly alive in our minds. They are lifeless because we cannot see their living bodies, hear their breath, or feel their beating hearts. They are skeletons of esoteric mental masturbation, buried deep inside the tombs of senseless intellectual pride.

On the other hand, if I say words such as "dragon", "fire", "sword", or "tree", it will be easy for anyone to instantly draw them on the surface of one's mental canvas. It is because these words are associated with living images; they are "alive" in our collective backwater of fantasy because, once we hear these words, they automatically summon their physical bodies within our field of vision.

Dead words exist for the sake of their own existence. They are ghosts of empty echoes, resonating in the voids of obscure references and endless wordplay. They came from nowhere, and are going nowhere.

Living words are different in the sense that they are fully exposed before our eyes. Once we hear them, we can instantly feel their presence without any explanation. This is the kind of personal warmth which we ought to leverage in order to touch the listener's heart.

[Caffeine, Sugar, and Fasting] April 3, 2025

For many years, I had been a lover of both coffee and sweets. I used to start every morning with a fresh cup of coffee and a morsel of glazed pastry, which I grabbed and enjoyed as soon as I got off the bed. The point of this daily routine was to kick off each day with a fresh burst of energy, aided by both the power of caffeine and an instant rush of gluten-friendly carbohydrates.

This habit, unfortunately, had an obnoxious side effect.

For the first two or three hours after the breakfast, I indeed rejoiced in the sheer sense of stimulation which it graciously provided. Endowed with the morning's initial flare of mental clarity and the fiery blessings of the sugary meal, I was able to leverage this brief period of excitement for tasks which required extra sharpness in one's mind. The hours which followed this initial phase of enchantment, however, often baffled me.

By the time the glorious effect of the morning ritual began to wear off (i.e. about 9 or 10 AM), I invariably crashed into the state of mild depression and fatigue. It was not really a surprise; after the initial spike of spiritual brightness, one could definitely expect a follow-up of the opposing effect as a counterbalancing mechanism - a combination of brain fog, anxiety, and a feeling of inner discomfort and suffocation.

Of course, if I wanted to prolong the delightful aspects of my morning ritual, I could just shove another cup of coffee down my throat in order to borrow a few more hours of productivity from my future self. And, guess what? I sometimes did exactly that, and enjoyed its short-term merit. Each time I did, though, it accrued even more "fatigue debt" in my body, causing me to become even more depressed by the time I reached the post-lunch slump (about 2PM or 3PM). And, by the time I faced this moment of mid-day crisis, I could not find a way out of it because it was too late for me to take yet another cup of coffee (If I did, it would then interfere with my night's sleep).

The problem was that, by kicking off every morning with caffeine and sugar, I was constantly sacrificing the quality of my afternoon hours for the sake of bloating the first few hours of the morning with an extra boost. It was after quite a number of years that I finally began to realize the sheer inefficiency of it.

Here was the truth. The first one or two hours of the morning did not really demand any sort of external stimuli to sharpen my mind. The reason was that the very act of waking up in the morning automatically triggered my brain to be extra alert for the first couple of hours, due to the fact that the body's cortisol level peaked by the time I woke up (Source: {%a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22187-cortisol"%}"Cortisol"{%/a%} - by Cleveland Clinic). Drinking a cup of coffee during this period turned out to be wasteful, since the sense of mental clarity offered by cortisol alone was already powerful enough to let me stay productive during that time.

Hence, injecting caffeine into my brain right after waking up also proved itself to be a bad idea for another reason. Every time I woke up in the morning, adenosine (i.e. sleep inducer) still lingered in my brain, waiting to be attached to the brain's receptors and be dissolved. Having a cup of coffee interfered with its prompt removal, since the receptors to which caffeine molecules bound themselves happened to be the same ones as those to which adenosine molecules were supposed to bind. As a result, the presence of caffeine delayed the dismissal of adenosine during the first few hours of the morning, causing them to retaliate with an attack of drowsiness after the lunch (Source: {%a target="_blank" href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/NKZpgdqs"%}"When should I drink coffee?"{%/a%} - by Andrew Huberman and Andy Galpin).

Another issue was that the initial surge of energy during the early morning, promoted by an enormous amount of caffeine as well as a huge dose of simple carbohydrate, induced my energy level to skyrocket and then quickly plunge into the swamp of depression afterwards (as a means of bringing the body back to its state of equilibrium). In my experience, a rapid rise was always followed by a rapid fall.

<011>

For these reasons, I began to realize that my feastful daily habit was unsustainable and prone to emotional instability. So I decided to abandon this age-long morning ritual (dedicated to summoning the gods of Starbucks Rewards Membership) and refactor the way I approached the problem of keeping myself productive all day long.

Here is the list of solutions I came up with.

1. First of all, I stopped drinking any caffeinated beverage during the first 1 to 2 hours in the morning. This helped the adenosine to be fully dissolved before they had any chance of being sustained by the presence of caffeine, thereby preventing them from striking me back with fatigue after lunch.

2. After this initial 1-2 hour time window, I promised myself to enjoy only a mild cup of black tea instead of a thickly brewed cup of dark roast coffee. Since a cup of black tea only contained about half as much caffeine as that of a cup of coffee (or even less), it helped me stimulate my brain in moderation. After all, too much excitement wasn't even beneficial to me; it deterred me from staying focused on one thing at a time. Also, consuming too much caffeine amplified its depressing side effect; reducing the amount helped me lower the intensity of the caffeine-induced slump and stay far more productive throughout the rest of the day.

3. What about sweets? Similar to caffeine, it definitely helped me fuel my brain during the first few hours of the morning. Just like caffeine, though, it revealed its own nasty downsides after a short period of time (such as depression, fatigue, anxiety, etc). Besides, I realized that health experts do not recommend eating anything right after waking up (Source: {%a target="_blank" href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/A3RrNlJK"%}"What is huberman saying about eating in the morning"{%/a%} - by Andrew Hubermann). This eventually encouraged me to begin skipping breakfast altogether, subsequently letting me exercise a mild form of intermittent fasting (i.e. at least 16 consecutive hours (per day) of not eating anything, starting from the evening and continuing all the way up to the next day's lunch).

All these 3 new habits, when practiced in combination, produced wondrous results. To be honest, it took me quite a while to get used to this new lifestyle. The lack of both caffeine and sugar during the first part of the day made me depressed at first, since I had been mildly addicted to these two stimulating substances for many years. I had to spend about a week to get used to the absence of coffee, and about 3 or 4 weeks to be comfortable with the absence of food during the initial few hours of the day. Once I fully adapted my body to this new pattern of life, however, it drastically improved the quality of my mental health (as well as physical health. See: {%a target="_blank" href="https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-to-live-longer-by-changing-the-way-we-eat"%}"David Sinclair: How to Change Your Diet to Live Longer"{%/a%}).

<012>

To be honest, I would say that the aforementioned change of habit did not give me any sort of "superpower" or anything extraordinary (I am still who I am). Based on what I have been experiencing, however, I can confidently tell that the state of my mind has become significantly more composed than before, letting me think more clearly and objectively (not just during the morning, but throughout most of the day).

Furthermore, it has been providing me with additional benefits besides psychological well-being. Abstinence from both coffee and sugary snacks helped me save money, since both of them are considerably more expensive than their healthier equivalents (especially in my country). Meanwhile, intermittent fasting helped my body regulate its blood sugar level and other aspects of metabolism way more frictionlessly than before, thus freeing me from carbohydrate addiction as well as irregular mood swings.

[To Every Lonely Artist] April 10, 2025

@@<hr>
@@<h3><b>Preliminary</b></h3>

Crafting a piece of art which appeals to everybody is a challenge, primarily because the audience consists of innumerable individuals, each of whom possesses a unique set of knowledge and expectations. Making every one of them appreciate your art is nearly impossible.

It is also a mark of virtue, however, to strive to let your art be accessible to as many people as possible. I do not mean that you ought to be a conformist; indeed, you will lose your own identity as a creator if you choose to become somebody else just for the sake of gratifying the cheap taste of the crowd. However, it is just as unwise to brand yourself as a lonely genius who is a victim of one's own extraordinary talent, and use it as an excuse to cut yourself off from the rest of the world.

And if you are to entertain the notion that the audience must be sufficiently "educated" in order to comprehend your art, it will function as a proof that it is your own lack of aptitude which made such a prerequisite an absolute necessity.

The root of the problem with which you might be struggling, with regard to the compatibility of your "creative endeavor" with that of the expectations of the general public, could be broken down to three major elements of rhetoric which often conflict with one another. I will go over them below.

@@<hr>
@@<h3><b>1. Ethos</b></h3>

In most cases, people prefer to see and hear things which are already familiar to them. It is especially true in the context of mainstream media, where consumers are expected to be spoon-fed the sort of products they can easily identify and sympathize with.

People want to see things they have already seen, and hear things they have already heard, down here on Earth, right under the Sun. Originality is an unforgivable sin in the mass market of cheap pre-packaged customer satisfaction, and anything which deviates from the norm even by the slightest degree gets thrown into the trash can as the most despicable form of pompous nonsense. The very moment your audience faces something which does not instantly please their eyes in the most obvious manner, they will turn they heads away without a glimpse of forethought.

Your average audience is heartless, and every one of your words will be rejected and utterly ignored unless you present it under the spotlight of shallow idolatry.

Thus the most viable strategy from an economic point of view, in the end, is to aim for the lowest common denominator and make sure that every split second of the customer's attention span is dedicated to what's the most appealing to the senses - sex, violence, gluttony, gambling, and whatnot. And in this bloodless world of business and profit optimization, your moral eloquence has no place to stand.

@@<hr>
@@<h3><b>2. Pathos</b></h3>

To be fair, some forms of art go deeper than mere sensual pleasure, and they manage to elaborate themselves quite far as to plead with the viewer's emotions. Soap opera, heroic stories, and other breeds of romanticism fall into this category. They appeal to the poet's heart, and paint the picture of one's fairy tale castle with colorful narratives.

This kind of art relies its momentum on the provocative energy of justice, remorse, compassion, and other moral sentiments. In the end, however, will such an emotional drama surmount the accusation that it is nothing more than a mere piece of political propaganda, designed to exploit the hopeless who are desperate enough to sacrifice their hearts for a charismatic demagogue?

Emotions are indeed mighty means of furnishing your art with motives. By sticking to the suggestive power of personal feelings, it will surely be able to attract the eyes of those who are in need of spiritual reassurance. If such an objective is the sole philosophy upon which your art is founded, however, on what basis will you be able to assert that it evinces more flavors of elegance than the myriad self-help (aka "personal development") lessons which flood the marketplace of hope sellers?

@@<hr>
@@<h3><b>3. Logos</b></h3>

The aforementioned two methods of rhetoric, which rely heavily on either senses or emotions, may perhaps be too shallow and soulless in your world of art. As a result, you may be convinced that it is pure reason alone which has the force to suggest to the audience that your art is not just a mere piece of mindless entertainment, but something which carries some philosophical substance in it - something which is of intellectual and scholastic value.

This too, however, is vanity. People who are too busy to spend time outside of their worldly matters (e.g. business, friendship, family issues, jobs, etc) are hardly likely to pay attention to sophisticated ideas which constitute the pastime of pure intellects.

People who do possess enough time and talent to appreciate intellectual endeavors (e.g. scholars), on the other hand, will refuse to pay attention to your ideas either because their egos are too strong to let them acknowledge that somebody else might know something which they do not know. These elites are busy endorsing their own intellectual superiority, so they are unwilling to give any credit to their potential competitors.

And you know what? You, too, will not be able to free yourself from this evil if you do not keep your own ego in check.

@@<hr>
@@<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

In the world of ethos, we stick to things which directly arouse our senses; it is the amusement park of superficial pleasure, devoid of philosophy. In the world of pathos, we struggle to win the hearts of people by means of emotional appeals; it is the bottomless pit of clumsy poetry in which nothing remains but the romance of momentary feelings. In the world of logos, we take refuge in the home of academic elites; it is the secret treehouse of "deep thinkers" - a select few who defend their secluded egos in their petty ivory tower of intellectual pride.

What, then, shall comprise a graceful work of art, which is endowed with its own philosophy yet still manages to grasp the souls of those who regard it? This is a tricky problem.

In my honest opinion, the best way to solve this is to endeavor to strike a fine balance among ethos, pathos, and logos.

Casual arcade games are sugarcoated with ethos, but they often lack both pathos and logos. Soap operas are rich in pathos, yet they are poor in logos. Minimalist arts and their intricate geometric patterns are filled with logos, but they fall short of ethos and pathos. It is only when we bring ethos, pathos, and logos together on a single line of narrative, that we will be able to formulate a universal kind of art whose voice resonates in everyone's ear. For at the focal point of their intersection, there is divinity.
