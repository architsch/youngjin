@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

Thomas O. Scarborough is one of the prominent philosophical writers in the United Kingdom, who has professional background in both theology and linguistics. "Metaphysical Notes" is one of his most iconic primers on the field of philosophy.

@@<h3><b>Key Notes:</b></h3>

1. There have traditionally been a multitude of metaphysical worldviews, yet today's interconnected (global) world demands us to come up with a new, reformed kind of metaphysics which unifies them all.

2. Our whole domain of reality can be modeled as a network of relations. Individual "things" (such as objects) do not really exist because each of them is defined in terms of how it is associated with other things. From a purely definitional standpoint, all we are left with is a set of relations, and "things" are just their points of intersection.

3. We define our world in terms of relations which we can identify in nature. However, there is a major dilemma between two methodologies. Whenever we focus on analyzing a small group of relations with utmost accuracy (as in natural sciences), we become nearsighted. Whenever we focus on surveying a large group of relations (as in human sciences), on the other hand, our reason loses precision.

4. The apparent gap between fact and value further increases the complexity of our analysis. Sometimes we notice that a set of relations we observe are not what they ought to be, which subsequently motivates us to carry out a list of actions to fix it. Yet we also know that other people have their own ideals, as well as that they communicate such ideals using their own semiotic methods (which are subject to misinterpretation). The prevalence of such multifaceted factors leaves us puzzled.

5. Therefore, we must somehow figure out the best way to "pick and choose" the kind of relations we ought to pay attention to. In order to do so, we should first realize that we have multiple centers (i.e. beliefs) in our domain of intuition, and proceed to come up with a super-center (i.e. super-belief) which will supersede all other centers. Once we pivot our attention around such an absolute and singular reference point, we will be able to build a solid foundation of our new metaphysics.

This is the backstory of what inspired the author to develop her own method of narrative design called "Narrative Bridging". As alluded <a href="https://katarinagyllenback.com/about/">Here</a>, for instance, Narrative Bridging primarily aims to bridge the gap between narratives (i.e. things which writers/designers focus on) and mechanics (i.e. things which programmers/engineers focus on), by means of iteration between the bottom-up (i.e. "mechanics-to-narratives") and top-down (i.e. "narratives-to-mechanics") design processes. In the former case, developers start by creating a set of basic building blocks of interaction, and then build layers of abstraction on top of them to give birth to a body of dynamic storytelling. In the latter case, developers start by devising the overall body of narratives (e.g. storyline, theme, etc), and then add systematic elements to it to give life to the story.

It has traditionally been claimed that "showing" is better than "telling" when it comes to communicating one's thoughts. This article, however, explains why even "showing" is not enough when we are delivering our narratives through an interactive medium instead of a one-way medium (such as a book or a film, in which the viewer's choice of action does not influence the story's progress). The author says that a dynamic (interactive) narrative should neither "tell" nor "show" the story, but instead "involve" the viewer by motivating him/her to make meaningful choices. The author further expounds that such a motivation can be triggered by introducing a conflict between two opposing forces (i.e. duality), and that one's recognition of such a conflict should be made possible by exploring the world and discovering its dual properties.

This article explains how a narrative can be modeled inside a "conceptual space" (i.e. a hypothetical geometry in which narrative elements are being placed as spatial objects). The underlying motivation behind this space-oriented approach is that each spatial axis (dimension) essentially represents a duality between two opposing forces (e.g. Good and Evil, Life and Death, Visible and Invisible, etc), so that, if we construct an N-dimensional conceptual space, we will be able to define every single narrative element as a combination of N dualistic attributes. Also, the center of the conceptual space may be considered the observer's position, and we may suppose that points close to the observer are things that are familiar, while points far away from the observer are things that are unfamiliar. The author explains that the space may as well be "warped" by the way in which narrative elements are placed (in the form of obstacles, shortcuts, etc), which will then drive the audience (observer) to either move from the familiar to the unfamiliar, or from the unfamiliar to the familiar (The former case could be described as "a moment of surprise", and the latter case could be described as "a moment of relief").

@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

Bertrand Russell is one of my favorite philosophers. One interesting thing about him is that his philosophical treatises, while they are written almost entirely in prose, still retain a great deal of mathematical (i.e. precise) reasoning in them (This is probably because Russell was not just a philosopher, but also a mathematician). For this reason, readers who are familiar with STEM subjects (e.g. math, science, and engineering) will find his writings a lot easier to understand than those written by other philosophers.

@@<h3><b>(1) The Problems of Philosophy</b></h3>

This is perhaps the best primer to philosophy in general (maybe not for humanity-related areas such as ethics and aesthetics, but definitely for metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology). In this book, Russell introduces some of the most common questions in philosophy such as the conflict between idealism and realism (i.e. "Matter is a byproduct of mind" vs "Mind is a byproduct of matter"), the definition of "idea" in Plato's metaphysical worldview, and so on. Then he even proceeds to explain his endeavors to define the whole of reality itself, as well as ways in which we may induce it from our sense-data and their apparent relations.

@@<h3><b>(2) The Analysis of Mind</b></h3>

This one is significantly more challenging to read than "The Problems of Philosophy". Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book due to its interdisciplinary approaches to the study of psychology, cognitive science, and problems of epistemology in general. Although there aren't any diagrams in this book (which is unfortunate because I think it would have helped a lot), the reader will probably be able to realize that many of the concepts which Russell introduces here can be illustrated in terms of graph theory (i.e. where ideas are denoted by vertices, and associations between ideas are denoted by edges). For example, according to Russell's reasoning, the difference between a "vague" idea and an "abstract" idea is that the former is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are not so closely associated with each other, whereas the latter is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are also closely associated with each other. This is one example, but there are many more, and they can all be rendered graphically using points and lines on a sheet of paper.

This is probably one of the easiest and most relaxed books ever written by Bertrand Russell. Unlike his other treatises, this one focuses on everyday human emotions and their hints on morality, rather than topics that are mathematically engaged. So if you are more of a fan of humanities than purely abstract concepts (such as those in metaphysics), I recommend reading it. It feels a bit like C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity", although Russell tends to speak of ethical topics from a more secular and rational viewpoint.

@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

David Hume is one of the most prominent empiricist philosophers of the enlightenment era. Contemporary readers, who have seriously investigated his writings, will readily come to the conclusion that his reductionist and experience-oriented worldview vividly parallels that of today's natural sciences. As a result, it is not hard for us to feel the invaluable contribution of his philosophy to the development of the modern mind, as well as its emphasis on the usage of scientific methods in discovering the secrets of our universe.

"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" is one of Hume's most popular treatises which expounds many aspects of his empirical worldview. It is not as widely known as his previous book called "A Treatise of Human Nature", but it is nevertheless a great primer for those who are interested in Hume's philosophy because it is written in a relatively concise manner (I have to say "relatively" because it is still pretty long).

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taxonomy of Psychological Elements</b></h3>

Hume begins his treatise by categorizing his elements of reason, such as "perceptions" (which can be subdivided into two classes called "impressions" and "ideas") and "objects of reason" (which can be subdivided into two classes called "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact"). The former refers to the basic building blocks (i.e. atoms) of our mental phenomena, and the latter refers to the ways in which these building blocks can combine with one another to form more complex meanings.

By means of categorization, Hume establishes a firm ground of terminologies which allows him to deliver his metaphysical concepts to the reader without causing too much confusion. One may claim that the way he draws artificial boundaries between seemingly intertwined concepts (e.g. between "impressions" and "ideas") is a bit too contrieved, yet I believe that it is a necessary evil which had to be maintained in order for Hume to give himself some solid pieces of intellectual toy to play with.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>On Causality</b></h3>

One of Hume's most widely discussed topics in this treatise is the issue of causality. According to his empirical faculty of reasoning, we can never directly sense the force of "necessary connexion" between a cause and its effect. All we can say from our experiences is that one type of events tend to occur in close proximity with another type of events, and that a high frequency of such correlative occurrences is the only clue which suggests us that these two types of events are causally related to each other (i.e. one is the cause and the other is the effect).

Hence, the very notion of causality itself, according to Hume as well as other highly empirical thinkers such as Bertrand Russell, may as well just be a manmade concept and not a fundamental part of reality. For example, when we observe that event B always immediately follows event A, does it mean that event A must be "causing" event B to occur? Wouldn't it also be plausible to suppose that A and B are just two predetermined parts of one underlying event?

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Personal Remarks</b></h3>

To be honest, most of the key lessons of this treatise are contained in the first four sections, which occupy roughly the first 25% of the volume. The rest of the book is, in my opinion, a bit verbose and spends rather too many words to explain the same old concept over and over again, and it feels more of Hume's personal rant against his philosophical opponents than an impersonal effort to unravel his line of logic. My impression is that he dedicated a huge portion of his book to express his own sentiments in regard to how his philosophy was unjustly dismissed and jeered at by backward thinkers.

However, I also would like to say that not all of his personal remarks deserve to be skimmed so lightly as though they are mere byproducts of his momentary indignation. During the very first section of his treatise (namely, "Of the Different Species of Philosophy"), Hume expresses his frustration with the fact that most people prefer "easy philosophy" which is inspired by emotional appeals and a strong sense of entertainment (e.g. political propaganda), over a more objective and truth-seeking kind of philosophy which, despite its sincere endeavors to touch the very essence of our philosophical problems, fails to win the heart of the mass because it does not sugarcoat itself with worldly passions.

And I must confess that this first section of the book really touched my heart - far more than I would expect from a philosophical treatise. It made me understand the sheer sense of frustration which Hume, after publishing "A Treatise of Human Nature", must have felt when he realized that his ambitious work was almost completely ignored by the public, and that his intellect had no place in this world.

Trying to define our reality based upon a set of metaphysical assumptions is perhaps the most common bigotry in Western philosophy. It plagues intellectuals with meaningless word play, making them draw artificial boundaries between ideas which aren't even clearly defined and therefore not strictly distinguishable (e.g. "mind vs body", "subject vs object", "nature vs nurture", "good vs evil", "something vs nothing", etc). We are discouraged from pointing out such logical absurdity, however, due to the fact that such an attempt is very likely to be dismissed as "postmodern nonsense".

When studying narratives, therefore, we must stop thinking in terms of the dichotomy between facts and feelings. Such a conceptual division may be useful in physics and other natural sciences, but not in the domain of cognitive science and psychology in which our very own thoughts are part of what we are supposed to analyze.

The main problem of an unconsciously inspired goal is that we cannot be sure of its universality. An extremely religious man, for example, has his religious belief so deeply ingrained in his unconscious mind, that he automatically assumes that others will instantly share his creed as soon as he reads off a few inspirational quotes from his holy manuscript.

A goal which is universal, therefore, must be able to express itself in a consciously identifiable format (i.e. in the form of something rational, rather than a mere assortment of vague symbols/metaphors which only appeal to the unconscious).
