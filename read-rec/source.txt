Thomas O. Scarborough is one of the prominent philosophical writers in the United Kingdom, who has professional background in both theology and linguistics. "Metaphysical Notes" is one of his most iconic primers on the field of philosophy.

@@<h3><b>Key Notes:</b></h3>

1. There have traditionally been a multitude of metaphysical worldviews, yet today's interconnected (global) world demands us to come up with a new, reformed kind of metaphysics which unifies them all.

2. Our whole domain of reality can be modeled as a network of relations. Individual "things" (such as objects) do not really exist because each of them is defined in terms of how it is associated with other things. From a purely definitional standpoint, all we are left with is a set of relations, and "things" are just their points of intersection.

3. We define our world in terms of relations which we can identify in nature. However, there is a major dilemma between two methodologies. Whenever we focus on analyzing a small group of relations with utmost accuracy (as in natural sciences), we become nearsighted. Whenever we focus on surveying a large group of relations (as in human sciences), on the other hand, our reason loses precision.

4. The apparent gap between fact and value further increases the complexity of our analysis. Sometimes we notice that a set of relations we observe are not what they ought to be, which subsequently motivates us to carry out a list of actions to fix it. Yet we also know that other people have their own ideals, as well as that they communicate such ideals using their own semiotic methods (which are subject to misinterpretation). The prevalence of such multifaceted factors leaves us puzzled.

5. Therefore, we must somehow figure out the best way to "pick and choose" the kind of relations we ought to pay attention to. In order to do so, we should first realize that we have multiple centers (i.e. beliefs) in our domain of intuition, and proceed to come up with a super-center (i.e. super-belief) which will supersede all other centers. Once we pivot our attention around such an absolute and singular reference point, we will be able to build a solid foundation of our new metaphysics.

As alluded {{a href="https://katarinagyllenback.com/about/"}}Here{{/a}}, for instance, Narrative Bridging primarily aims to bridge the gap between narratives (i.e. things which writers/designers focus on) and mechanics (i.e. things which programmers/engineers focus on), by means of iteration between the bottom-up (i.e. "mechanics-to-narratives") and top-down (i.e. "narratives-to-mechanics") design processes. In the former case, developers start by creating a set of basic building blocks of interaction, and then build layers of abstraction on top of them to give birth to a body of dynamic storytelling. In the latter case, developers start by devising the overall body of narratives (e.g. storyline, theme, etc), and then add systematic elements to it to give life to the story.

This article, however, explains why even "showing" is not enough when we are delivering our narratives through an interactive medium instead of a one-way medium (such as a book or a film, in which the viewer's choice of action does not influence the story's progress). The author says that a dynamic (interactive) narrative should neither "tell" nor "show" the story, but instead "involve" the viewer by motivating him/her to make meaningful choices. The author further expounds that such a motivation can be triggered by introducing a conflict between two opposing forces (i.e. duality), and that one's recognition of such a conflict should be made possible by exploring the world and discovering its dual properties.

This article explains how a narrative can be modeled inside a "conceptual space" (i.e. a hypothetical geometry in which narrative elements are being placed as spatial objects). The underlying motivation behind this space-oriented approach is that each spatial axis (dimension) essentially represents a duality between two opposing forces (e.g. Good and Evil, Life and Death, Visible and Invisible, etc), so that, if we construct an N-dimensional conceptual space, we will be able to define every single narrative element as a combination of N dualistic attributes. Also, the center of the conceptual space may be considered the observer's position, and we may suppose that points close to the observer are things that are familiar, while points far away from the observer are things that are unfamiliar. The author explains that the space may as well be "warped" by the way in which narrative elements are placed (in the form of obstacles, shortcuts, etc), which will then drive the audience (observer) to either move from the familiar to the unfamiliar, or from the unfamiliar to the familiar (The former case could be described as "a moment of surprise", and the latter case could be described as "a moment of relief").

Bertrand Russell is one of my favorite philosophers. One interesting thing about him is that his philosophical treatises, while they are written almost entirely in prose, still retain a great deal of mathematical (i.e. precise) reasoning in them (This is probably because Russell was not just a philosopher, but also a mathematician). For this reason, readers who are familiar with STEM subjects (e.g. math, science, and engineering) will find his writings a lot easier to understand than those written by other philosophers.

@@<h3><b>(1) The Problems of Philosophy</b></h3>

This is perhaps the best primer to philosophy in general (maybe not for humanity-related areas such as ethics and aesthetics, but definitely for metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology). In this book, Russell introduces some of the most common questions in philosophy such as the conflict between idealism and realism (i.e. "Matter is a byproduct of mind" vs "Mind is a byproduct of matter"), the definition of "idea" in Plato's metaphysical worldview, and so on. Then he even proceeds to explain his endeavors to define the whole of reality itself, as well as ways in which we may induce it from our sense-data and their apparent relations.

This one is significantly more challenging to read than "The Problems of Philosophy". Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book due to its interdisciplinary approaches to the study of psychology, cognitive science, and problems of epistemology in general. Although there aren't any diagrams in this book (which is unfortunate because I think it would have helped a lot), the reader will probably be able to realize that many of the concepts which Russell introduces here can be illustrated in terms of graph theory (i.e. where ideas are denoted by vertices, and associations between ideas are denoted by edges). For example, according to Russell's reasoning, the difference between a "vague" idea and an "abstract" idea is that the former is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are not so closely associated with each other, whereas the latter is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are also closely associated with each other. This is one example, but there are many more, and they can all be rendered graphically using points and lines on a sheet of paper.

This is probably one of the easiest and most relaxed books ever written by Bertrand Russell. Unlike his other treatises, this one focuses on everyday human emotions and their hints on morality, rather than topics that are mathematically engaged. So if you are more of a fan of humanities than purely abstract concepts (such as those in metaphysics), I recommend reading it. It feels a bit like C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity", although Russell tends to speak of ethical topics from a more secular and rational viewpoint.

@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

David Hume is one of the most prominent empiricist philosophers of the enlightenment era. Contemporary readers, who have seriously investigated his writings, will readily come to the conclusion that his reductionist and experience-oriented worldview vividly parallels that of today's natural sciences. As a result, it is not hard for us to feel the invaluable contribution of his philosophy to the development of the modern mind, as well as its emphasis on the usage of scientific methods in discovering the secrets of our universe.

"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" is one of Hume's most popular treatises which expounds many aspects of his empirical worldview. It is not as widely known as his previous book called "A Treatise of Human Nature", but it is nevertheless a great primer for those who are interested in Hume's philosophy because it is written in a relatively concise manner (I have to say "relatively" because it is still pretty long).

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taxonomy of Psychological Elements</b></h3>

Hume begins his treatise by categorizing his elements of reason, such as "perceptions" (which can be subdivided into two classes called "impressions" and "ideas") and "objects of reason" (which can be subdivided into two classes called "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact"). The former refers to the basic building blocks (i.e. atoms) of our mental phenomena, and the latter refers to the ways in which these building blocks can combine with one another to form more complex meanings.

By means of categorization, Hume establishes a firm ground of terminologies which allows him to deliver his metaphysical concepts to the reader without causing too much confusion. One may claim that the way he draws artificial boundaries between seemingly intertwined concepts (e.g. between "impressions" and "ideas") is a bit too contrieved, yet I believe that it is a necessary evil which had to be maintained in order for Hume to give himself some solid pieces of intellectual toy to play with.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>On Causality</b></h3>

One of Hume's most widely discussed topics in this treatise is the issue of causality. According to his empirical faculty of reasoning, we can never directly sense the force of "necessary connexion" between a cause and its effect. All we can say from our experiences is that one type of events tend to occur in close proximity with another type of events, and that a high frequency of such correlative occurrences is the only clue which suggests us that these two types of events are causally related to each other (i.e. one is the cause and the other is the effect).

Hence, the very notion of causality itself, according to Hume as well as other highly empirical thinkers such as Bertrand Russell, may as well just be a manmade concept and not a fundamental part of reality. For example, when we observe that event B always immediately follows event A, does it mean that event A must be "causing" event B to occur? Wouldn't it also be plausible to suppose that A and B are just two predetermined parts of one underlying event?

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Personal Remarks</b></h3>

To be honest, most of the key lessons of this treatise are contained in the first four sections, which occupy roughly the first 25% of the volume. The rest of the book is, in my opinion, a bit verbose and spends rather too many words to explain the same old concept over and over again, and it feels more of Hume's personal rant against his philosophical opponents than an impersonal effort to unravel his line of logic. My impression is that he dedicated a huge portion of his book to express his own sentiments in regard to how his philosophy was unjustly dismissed and jeered at by backward thinkers.

However, I also would like to say that not all of his personal remarks deserve to be skimmed so lightly as though they are mere byproducts of his momentary indignation. During the very first section of his treatise (namely, "Of the Different Species of Philosophy"), Hume expresses his frustration with the fact that most people prefer "easy philosophy" which is inspired by emotional appeals and a strong sense of entertainment (e.g. political propaganda), over a more objective and truth-seeking kind of philosophy which, despite its sincere endeavors to touch the very essence of our philosophical problems, fails to win the heart of the mass because it does not sugarcoat itself with worldly passions.

And I must confess that this first section of the book really touched my heart - far more than I would expect from a philosophical treatise. It made me understand the sheer sense of frustration which Hume, after publishing "A Treatise of Human Nature", must have felt when he realized that his ambitious work was almost completely ignored by the public, and that his intellect had no place in this world.

Trying to define our reality based upon a set of metaphysical assumptions is perhaps the most common bigotry in Western philosophy.

We are discouraged from pointing out such logical absurdity, however, due to the fact that such an attempt is very likely to be dismissed as "postmodern nonsense".

When studying narratives, therefore, we must stop thinking in terms of the dichotomy between facts and feelings.

A goal which is universal, therefore, must be able to express itself in a consciously identifiable format (i.e. in the form of something rational, rather than a mere assortment of vague symbols/metaphors which only appeal to the unconscious).

There are many novels which can easily be classified as science fiction. On the other hand, it seems to me that there are only a handful of novels which could be classified as "math fiction".

Why is this so? I think one of the most prominent reasons why it is so difficult to find a work of "math fiction" is that math, unlike popular science, is much harder to represent in tangible forms.

While science does possess its own share of profound, esoteric concepts (especially in the field of theoretical physics), we can sort of tell that at least the popular representation of it is full of sparkling rainbow-colored liquid bottles, explosions, spaceships, laser guns, flying robots, and smart-looking British gentlemen in white gowns. Mathematics, on the contrary, offers a lot less to show when it comes to exhibiting its own bread and circuses.

For this reason, it is a genuine surprise to see that the 19th century novel, "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions", successfully presents us with its own fictional world which is made of purely mathematical ideas yet still manages to entertain us. Starting with the very concept of "dimension" in Euclidean space, the author (Edwin Abbott) invites the reader to his wondrous universe of two-dimensional beings, whose bodies are flat geometric shapes (such as circles, squares, triangles, etc) instead of three-dimensional forms.

(1) The number of sides of a geometric shape represents its rank in the social hierarchy.
(2) Lower-class shapes possess sharp edges, so they can technically kill (i.e. purge) all the round-shaped elites if they want to (This may be an allusion to the French Revolution and downfall of aristocracy in general).
(3) Women are represented by line segments (because they were considered "intellectually narrow" back then).
(4) Nobody in Flatland really understands the existence of higher dimensions because they are inherently narrow-minded (i.e. due to their narrow, "flat" brains), which can be interpreted as religious dogma & persecution.
(5) Visitation of a higher-dimensional entity (before the face of the protagonist called "A Square") signifies a divine revelation, which can never be fully comprehended by lower-dimensional beings.

In a way, therefore, Flatland can be interpreted as a social commentary, a satire, and a metaphor of human nature in general, allegorically conveyed via the language of mathematics. It is truly a multidisciplinary piece of literature, especially if you consider the time period during which it was written.

@@<h3><b>Criticism</b></h3>

One piece of criticism against this novel though, which I guess is valid to some extent, is that its narratives tend to be a bit "shallow" compared to those of other famous literary works.

The story of Flatland is primarily centered around the lamentations of the protagonist (i.e. A Square) as a harbinger of truth, who is being persecuted by the mass for revealing provocative ideas. He is the "lone genius" in this fictional universe, who silently rebels against the norm of the mainstream opinion by means of circumventory endeavors (such as writing a treatise which implicitly suggests the existence of the third dimension based upon the hypothetical space called "Thoughtland"), which is kind of reminiscent of how Copernicus dodged the accusations from the religious leaders by claiming that his heliocentric model of the universe is "just a hypothesis which aims to make calculations easier".

Such an "oppressed hero" archetype is indeed a powerful means of reinforcing the reader's ego, since it basically whispers to our ears, "Nobody understands you, but I do! You are the only one who knows the truth, and the rest of the world is to blame!". However, this dichotomous breed of worldview significantly undermines the objectiveness (i.e. value-neutrality) of the overall narrative, thereby giving off cheap impressions which even look a bit embarrassingly juvenile at times.

@@<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

Nevertheless, Flatland is still an iconic work of classic when it comes to the experimental spirit of the Victorian era. The way in which Edwin Abbott integrated an area of pure academic knowledge into his own narrative world is such a subtle kind of intellectual gem which can hardly be found elsewhere. And I definitely recommend everyone to partake in their journey to Flatland and use it as a fountain of multifaceted inspirations.

(Side Note: The first time I heard about Flatland was when my AP Calculus teacher presented its movie version to his students. He was one of the best teachers I have ever met in high school!)

@@<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

When I was an elementary/middle school student in Korea, I used to be an avid reader of Bernard Werber's novels.

For a bit of background information, I would like to introduce Bernard Werber to those who have not heard of his name. He used to be (or still is) the most popular French novelist in my country (Korea) during the 2000s. He published his first major novel called "The Ants" (Les Fourmis) back in the early 90s, and rapidly gained popularity afterwards.

The exact genre of his writings is hard to pinpoint because they are mostly a mixture of science fiction, philosophical rhetorics, religious allusions, and spiritual connotations. In his fictional universe, Bernard Werber combines his scientific knowledge with metaphysical symbolism (e.g. meaning of numbers, dimensional shift in consciousness, etc) to create his own surreal yet surprisingly rational sort of imaginations. Some of them are:

(1) A scientific device which translates the language of ants and the language of human beings to each other, allowing the ants' society and human society to come to a state of mutual understanding and "ascend" together to the next step of biological evolution.

(2) What if the afterlife is a physical space which you can temporarily visit and explore, like an astronaut, with the aid of a special equipment (e.g. short-term coma inducer)?

(3) What if gods (deities) are entities who occupy different levels of control in our universe, and that every god is being governed by higher-level gods, and so on?

(4) A "universe box" - an aquarium-like electronic appliance in which you can generate your own miniature universe (with its own tiny little galaxies, planets, etc).

... and so forth. The ideas present in his stories are so intriguingly multidisciplinary and open-ended, that they oftentimes feel as though they can be used as perpetual fountains of inspirations.

@@<h3><b>Popularity in Korea</b></h3>

One of the interesting facts is that Bernard Werber has acquired far more fame in my country than in his home country (France). He has not been quite as successful in the United States either, which I can tell because only a small fraction of his novels have officially been translated into English.

I will tell you an example. Back when I was a high school student in America, I tried to find English editions of Bernard Werber's novels in the local library. However, I only succeeded in discovering the English translation of one of his novels called "Empire of the Ants" (i.e. the American title for "Les Fourmis", which, to my surprise, belonged to the library's "Teen Fiction" corner). What was interesting was that the library's "Korean Books" corner had a plenty of Korean editions of his books, including some of his more recent works such as "The Mirror of Cassandra" (Le Miroir de Cassandre).

So, what was the secret behind his disproportionate fame in Korea, as opposed to other countries including France? Bernard Werber has once mentioned in his interview with his Korean translater (이세욱) that the reason why his writings are far more popular in Korea is probably that Koreans are more attentive to new and experimental ideas than those in France who are rather "stuck" in old-fashioned ways of thinking.

I won't necessarily try to dismantle the authenticity of his conjecture, but one thing I believe is that it is generally not so hard to display rather blind affection toward a group of people who have shown far more admiration to you than others. Personally, as someone who spent almost the entire childhood in Korea, I want to insist that the vast majority of people in my homeland are not nearly as "open-minded" as he himself fancies them to be.

Some observations can be made in regard to the major differences between Bernard Werber's novels and those of other French writers, as means of explaining the origin of his megalithic traction in Korea.

(1) His novels are far more concise and fast-paced than other French novels. Since people in Korea usually have much tighter work schedules than those in France, they do not have enough time to read long, verbose stories. The succinctness of his writings helps them quickly pick up all the major plots of the story within a relatively short period of time.

(2) He repeatedly summarizes his main ideas in the form of "entries from an encyclopedia", thus periodically helping the reader recapitulate what he/she had just read in the preceding chapter. Since Korea's private educational institutions often emphasize the importance of summarizing a set of key concepts (for more efficient test preparation, etc), his habit of periodic recap probably resonated with the method of learning to which many Koreans were heavily accustomed.

... etc.

Other observations may as well be made, regarding the time period during which he became popular in my country. As far as I am able to recall, Bernard Werber's fame in Korea peaked during the mid 2000s. In order to understand the underlying implication of this timing, we must first take a look at the brief history of what happened in my country during that passage in history.

@@<h3><b>Foundation of His Success in Korea</b></h3>

Let us rewind the clock a bit. In 1997, a horrible economic crisis struck Korea, putting it on the verge of national backruptcy. This disaster was mostly mitigated within a fairly short period of time, yet its legacy involved massive unemployment and layoffs (... which explains why the "PC bang" businesses and the 1998 game "Starcraft" became so successful during that time; unemployed young adults just needed somewhere to spend time on and distract themselves from the dark reality).

By the late 90s and early 2000s, along with the rapid distribution of personal computers and high-speed internet (which was part of the government's plan to revive the economy through the growth of the IT industry), a new trend began to dominate the early Korean web communities; it was called "yup-ghi" (엽기), which can be translated into English as "anything bizarre", "anything weird", or "anything wildly irrational".

Many Korean websites during this time period featured numerous "yup-ghi" memes on their pages, which included:

(1) Images that were photoshopped in all sorts of grostesque ways (e.g. a bird with a dog's head, a half-cut strawberry with lemon-like inside, etc),

(2) Short written stories which were a bit inappropriate for children to read, and

(3) Flash animations & games which displayed gory and sexually explicit scenes,

... and many others! There weren't that many camera-recorded videos back then, since the internet connection was not as fast as to support their real-time transmission. Therefore, most motion pictures on the internet were made using Flash, up until the point at which YouTube and other online video platforms (such as AfreecaTV and PandoraTV) started to become mainstream (mid 2000s).

The origin of the "yup-ghi" outbreak in my country's web, in my opinion, can be traced back to the aftermath of the economic crisis in 1997. First, the rapid growth of instability in the job market forced many of the job-seekers at the time to question their old way of living.

The society used to grant people a promising future as long as they followed their standard educational curriculum, studied diligently, and worked rigorously. The economy continued to prosper, and everyone was told that bright opportunities would always be within their reach if they tried hard enough.

Then, the economic crisis broke out, and the vast majority of young, current/future employees in their 20s/30s saw their seniors being laid off despite having labored relentlessly for decades. They clearly saw, before their eyes, that the perpetual supply of hope that the mainstream media was feeding them all turned out to be in vain, and that even the utmost degree of loyalty to one's employer, as well as other forms of authority, could be entirely ignored and thrown into the garbage bin all of a sudden, as though it was nothing worth of respect at all.

This sense of betrayal gave birth to a rather reserved yet pervasive countercultural movement, which contributed to the rise of the "yup-ghi" genre of entertainment in Korean web communities. The origin of "yup-ghi", to me, could be interpreted as a way of expressing one's frustration with the standard, traditional set of moral values - an utter rejection of old and well-established habits in life.

This unforeseen branch of subculture, combined with the Y2K (cyberpunk + frutiger aero) aesthetics of the time, vastly shaped the cultural landscape of Korea's younger generations (Gen X and Millennials) during the early 2000s.

Then, by the early to mid 2000s or so, Bernard Werber rapidly became popular in my country. His books began to grab people's attention due to the way in which they exhibited collections of shockingly wild and creative ideas, which ventured to cross the boundaries between vastly different areas of knowledge such as science, philosophy, religions, and even pure mathematics (e.g. symbolism of numbers + geometry of meaning).

One of the major selling points in his books was their direct appeal to "something new". Exhausted by years of unemployment, financial shortcomings, lack of opportunities, and zero prospect for future growth, many young Korean readers at the time desperately searched for game-changing ideas - little nutshells of imagination which are so fresh and revolutionary in themselves, that they might even promise to offer a brand new key to unlock one's way out of the prison of hopelessness.

Bernard Werber's sparkling suggestion of a better future, reinforced by his subtle innuendos borrowed from New Age spiritualism, brought a fresh air of vivid imaginations to the readers, and helped them believe that they, too, will some day be able to claim their own territory in the infinite space of phantasmagoria. This, I believe, is one of the main factors which contributed to Bernard Werber's insane popularity in the mid 2000s.

@@<h3><b>Interesting Aspects</b></h3>

Aside from the historical & cultural circumstances, I believe that Bernard Werber's books definitely possess their own unique values, regardless of in which country he happened to acquire the highest degree of recognition. Here are some of the remarkable differences in his writings as opposed to those of others:

(1) His work of fiction often contains multiple storylines which run in parallel (similar to a Sitcom). These storylines eventually join into one in the end, thereby completing the story's full picture. This, I think, is such a multifaceted (i.e. multidimensional) approach to fiction-writing - a wondrous way of impelling the reader to view the same fictional world in multiple angles.

(2) He uses his underlying philosophical creeds as means of constructing his fictional universe, and does not hesitate to explicitly state them as side notes inside the story itself (e.g. in the form of references to "The Encyclopedia of the Absolute and Relative Knowledge" (L'Encyclopédie du savoir relatif et absolu), for example). This is a great way to convince the reader that his story has an "additional depth" to it, and that the story itself is just a means of giving a hint of a profound body of knowledge which is hidden elsewhere.

(3) Quite frequently, either directly or indirectly, he emphasizes the significance of viewing a widely known piece of information (e.g. scientific knowledge) from an unusual perspective, such as: "The appearance of cancer cells could be interpreted as a signal which is being sent by unknown beings as an attempt to communicate with us", and so forth. This kind of inner thought experiment encourages the reader to observe small, ordinary things in our everyday lives with fresh new eyes.

@@<h3><b>In Retrospect...</b></h3>

I spent my childhood in the 2000s. And, as a result, I was hugely influenced by Bernard Werber's books. I recall reading his "The Tree of Possibles" (L'Arbre des possibles), "The Encyclopedia of Relative and Absolute Knowledge" (L'Encyclopédie du savoir relatif et absolu), "The Ants" (Les Fourmis) series, "The Butterfly of the Stars" (Le papillon des étoiles), and many others. These books were my absolute favorite, especially because I was a fan of philosophical science fiction back when I was a kid (I still am, kind of, although my definition of "philosophical science fiction" changed a bit over time).

While I did enjoy reading other works of science fiction as well, such as those written by H.G. Wells, Bernard Werber's books had a special charm in them which could hardly be found elsewhere. It was the overall impression that he always strived to fill his fictional universe with the most intellectually rebellious yet compassionate worldview, which fills the reader's heart with a profound sense of philanthropy. Such a sentiment is quite difficult to explain textually, but I am sure that those who have been immersed in his writings will perhaps share the sense of what I am trying to convey.

There is, however, a seriously disturbing aspect of his literary works which, in retrospect, makes me even cringe a bit.

Bernard Werber is indeed an effective writer when it comes to quickly raising the reader's passion. He hardly fails to populate his stories with bright ideas which can definitely be considered "creative" by anyone who stumbles upon them, and it is without a doubt that he is one of the most talented fiction writers when it comes to exhibiting pure imaginations in a strangely convincing manner.

From a narrative point of view, though, I could not help myself questioning the moral depth of his writings as I grew up. When I was an elementary/middle school student, I avidly consumed his novels as though they were the most profound philosophical treatises. As time passed by and I got acquainted with many masterpieces in the realm of classical literature, I began to realize that his fictional worldview is embarrassingly shallow.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Criticism</b></h3>

One of the commonly recurring themes in Bernard Werber's fiction is that of the "struggle of a few intellectuals against the stupidity of the mass". Typically, in his story, a highly sophisticated and creative protagonist constantly gets persecuted by others who are far intellectually inferior to him. This "lonely genius", who gradually becomes tired of the sheer prevalence of idiots who never understand (or even try to understand) his unique philosophical perspective, eventually partakes in an adventure and finds solace in his own outworldly journey, where he finds friendship in a tiny circle of likeminded geniuses who are ready to acknowledge how smart he is.

His fictional worldview can be illustrated as a dichotomy between "those who are enlightened" and "those who are not". His protagonists (i.e. the "enlightened ones") are the creatives, innovators, and ones who never fail to exercise the utmost degree of imaginative freedom. The rest of his fictional characters, on the other hand, are vulgar, superficial, pretentious materialists who are solely obsessed with worldly interests (e.g. money, relationship) and never pay attention to deep, philosophical discourses. In his world, they are the "dumb ones" who are only interested in buying luxury goods (e.g. sports cars), watching romantic comedy movies, and chasing celebrities who make profit out of big, empty words.

The thing is, I do wholeheartedly share the sentiment which Bernard Werber conveys here, I really do. Sometimes I cannot help myself feeling that the world is almost entirely filled with clueless morons who are not even capable of grasping the slightest fraction of the area of intellect which I am able to see and understand. This is how I feel not so infrequently, to be honest.

Yet, expressing such a sentiment in so explicit a manner in one's literary work is a somewhat different story. Drawing a hard division between "those who are enlightened" and "those who are too stupid to be enlightened" is indeed a powerful means of fueling the reader's ego, since it convinces him that he, who is able to read Bernard Werber's books and understand the words written in them, must certainly be the "chosen one" who is intellectually superior to those who do not necessarily agree with his opinions. But if this is pretty much the boundary of how far Bernard Werber's narrative manages to reach (aside from spiritual libertarianism), I will say that it is the reader's moral obligation to outgrow the scope of the author's philosophy at some point in life.
