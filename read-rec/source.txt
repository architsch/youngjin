@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

Thomas O. Scarborough is one of the prominent philosophical writers in the United Kingdom, who has professional background in both theology and linguistics. "Metaphysical Notes" is one of his most iconic primers on the field of philosophy.

@@<h3><b>Key Notes:</b></h3>

1. There have traditionally been a multitude of metaphysical worldviews, yet today's interconnected (global) world demands us to come up with a new, reformed kind of metaphysics which unifies them all.

2. Our whole domain of reality can be modeled as a network of relations. Individual "things" (such as objects) do not really exist because each of them is defined in terms of how it is associated with other things. From a purely definitional standpoint, all we are left with is a set of relations, and "things" are just their points of intersection.

3. We define our world in terms of relations which we can identify in nature. However, there is a major dilemma between two methodologies. Whenever we focus on analyzing a small group of relations with utmost accuracy (as in natural sciences), we become nearsighted. Whenever we focus on surveying a large group of relations (as in human sciences), on the other hand, our reason loses precision.

4. The apparent gap between fact and value further increases the complexity of our analysis. Sometimes we notice that a set of relations we observe are not what they ought to be, which subsequently motivates us to carry out a list of actions to fix it. Yet we also know that other people have their own ideals, as well as that they communicate such ideals using their own semiotic methods (which are subject to misinterpretation). The prevalence of such multifaceted factors leaves us puzzled.

5. Therefore, we must somehow figure out the best way to "pick and choose" the kind of relations we ought to pay attention to. In order to do so, we should first realize that we have multiple centers (i.e. beliefs) in our domain of intuition, and proceed to come up with a super-center (i.e. super-belief) which will supersede all other centers. Once we pivot our attention around such an absolute and singular reference point, we will be able to build a solid foundation of our new metaphysics.

Katarina Gyllenbäck is a narrative game designer with an academic background in both Drama & Theatre Arts and Computer Science. She invented a brand new method of narrative design called "Narrative Bridging", and has conducted numerous interdisciplinary researches in the field of interactive media (including video games).

She used to be a director and scriptwriter for the motion picture industry, but then she is also well-known as a researcher at SICS (Swedish Institute of Computer Science) and other academic institutions, as well as a co-founder of CIN (Creating Interactive Narrative). She is also a lifelong educator who tutors, lectures, and writes on topics which pertain to both the science of narratives, the science of computation, and their domain of interplay (i.e. science of cognition).

Outside of academia, she worked as a design director & narrative designer of video games at a number of software development studios, including Bambino Games and Softbox AB.

This is the backstory of what inspired the author to develop her own method of narrative design called "Narrative Bridging". As alluded <a href="https://katarinagyllenback.com/about/">Here</a>, for instance, Narrative Bridging primarily aims to bridge the gap between narratives (i.e. things which writers/designers focus on) and mechanics (i.e. things which programmers/engineers focus on), by means of iteration between the bottom-up (i.e. "mechanics-to-narratives") and top-down (i.e. "narratives-to-mechanics") design processes. In the former case, developers start by creating a set of basic building blocks of interaction, and then build layers of abstraction on top of them to give birth to a body of dynamic storytelling. In the latter case, developers start by devising the overall body of narratives (e.g. storyline, theme, etc), and then add systematic elements to it to give life to the story.

It has traditionally been claimed that "showing" is better than "telling" when it comes to communicating one's thoughts. This article, however, explains why even "showing" is not enough when we are delivering our narratives through an interactive medium instead of a one-way medium (such as a book or a film, in which the viewer's choice of action does not influence the story's progress). The author says that a dynamic (interactive) narrative should neither "tell" nor "show" the story, but instead "involve" the viewer by motivating him/her to make meaningful choices. The author further expounds that such a motivation can be triggered by introducing a conflict between two opposing forces (i.e. duality), and that one's recognition of such a conflict should be made possible by exploring the world and discovering its dual properties.

@@<h3><a href="https://katarinagyllenback.com/2023/03/16/part-11-the-meaning-makers-space/">PART 11, THE MEANING-MAKER’S SPACE</a></h3>
This article explains how a narrative can be modeled inside a "conceptual space" (i.e. a hypothetical geometry in which narrative elements are being placed as spatial objects). The underlying motivation behind this space-oriented approach is that each spatial axis (dimension) essentially represents a duality between two opposing forces (e.g. Good and Evil, Life and Death, Visible and Invisible, etc), so that, if we construct an N-dimensional conceptual space, we will be able to define every single narrative element as a combination of N dualistic attributes. Also, the center of the conceptual space may be considered the observer's position, and we may suppose that points close to the observer are things that are familiar, while points far away from the observer are things that are unfamiliar. The author explains that the space may as well be "warped" by the way in which narrative elements are placed (in the form of obstacles, shortcuts, etc), which will then drive the audience (observer) to either move from the familiar to the unfamiliar, or from the unfamiliar to the familiar (The former case could be described as "a moment of surprise", and the latter case could be described as "a moment of relief").

Katarina Gyllenbäck is a researcher, educator, and writer in the field of narrative design. Her areas of expertise include storytelling, drama & theatre, and interactive media such as games. She is also known for her unique method of narrative construction called "Narrative Bridging".

"PART 2, THE BENEFIT AND DISADVANTAGE OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS" is one of her early blog articles which explains the role of the unconscious in the recognition of a goal in a narrative, as well as how a person's "fear of the unknown" becomes an implicit motive behind one's willingness to learn by means of exploration.

@@<h3><b>Key Note 1:</b></h3>

When we are talking about a goal which is already meaningful to us, we often overlook the fact that other people do not necessarily share the same goal. This is because one's unconscious mind tends to process familiar pieces of information automatically behind the scene, without informing the conscious mind.

<font color="#707070"><b>Related quote from the article:</b></font>

(...) the cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner says the reason why we find it hard to achieve consciousness about how we interpret (evaluate) information and create meaning is that we are “too expert” and we cannot see what we so easily do automatically. Bruner calls the condition the “unconsciousness of the automatic” (Bruner, 1996).

@@<h3><b>Key Note 2:</b></h3>

Therefore, aiming for humanity's common goal is oftentimes a fast and easy solution to resolve the problem of dissonance. This will effectively "sync up" our unconscious minds, letting us understand each other deeply (not just superficially).

@@<h3><b>Key Note 3:</b></h3>

A narrative, on the other hand, usually involves a conflict among multiple goals. However, such a conflict is desirable because it is fictional. The only requirement is that the constructor of a narrative must not be too emotionally attached to any one of the goals specifically; that is, the constructor must remain "value neutral" (lest his/her work be classified as a political propaganda).

@@<h3><b>Key Note 4:</b></h3>

Whenever we encounter something that is unfamiliar to us, we feel urged to make sense of it by means of observation and reasoning. The designer can create this kind of motivation by selectively hiding information from the viewer (e.g. 'Fog of War' in video games).

Since we like to avoid the anxiety that occurs when not understanding (by seeing strange things that we can´t identify) we create meanings (assumptions) to get in control. (...)

[Books by Bertrand Russell] June 20, 2024

@@<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>

Bertrand Russell is one of my favorite philosophers. One interesting thing about him is that his philosophical treatises, while they are written almost entirely in prose, still retain a great deal of mathematical (i.e. precise) reasoning in them (This is probably because Russell was not just a philosopher, but also a mathematician). For this reason, readers who are familiar with STEM subjects (e.g. math, science, and engineering) will find his writings a lot easier to understand than those written by other philosophers.

<006>

@@<hr>

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>(1) The Problems of Philosophy</b></h3>

This is perhaps the best primer to philosophy in general (maybe not for humanity-related areas such as ethics and aesthetics, but definitely for metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology). In this book, Russell introduces some of the most common questions in philosophy such as the conflict between idealism and realism (i.e. "Matter is a byproduct of mind" vs "Mind is a byproduct of matter"), the definition of "idea" in Plato's metaphysical worldview, and so on. Then he even proceeds to explain his endeavors to define the whole of reality itself, as well as ways in which we may induce it from our sense-data and their apparent relations.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>(2) The Analysis of Mind</b></h3>

This one is significantly more challenging to read than "The Problems of Philosophy". Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book due to its interdisciplinary approaches to the study of psychology, cognitive science, and problems of epistemology in general. Although there aren't any diagrams in this book (which is unfortunate because I think it would have helped a lot), the reader will probably be able to realize that many of the concepts which Russell introduces here can be illustrated in terms of graph theory (i.e. where ideas are denoted by vertices, and associations between ideas are denoted by edges). For example, according to Russell's reasoning, the difference between a "vague" idea and an "abstract" idea is that the former is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are not so closely associated with each other, whereas the latter is an idea which is closely associated with ideas that are also closely associated with each other. This is one example, but there are many more, and they can all be rendered graphically using points and lines on a sheet of paper.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>(3) The Conquest of Happiness</b></h3>

This is probably one of the easiest and most relaxed books ever written by Bertrand Russell. Unlike his other treatises, this one focuses on everyday human emotions and their hints on morality, rather than topics that are mathematically engaged. So if you are more of a fan of humanities than purely abstract concepts (such as those in metaphysics), I recommend reading it. It feels a bit like C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity", although Russell tends to speak of ethical topics from a more secular and rational viewpoint.

People learn new things when they naturally become curious, not when they are forced to be curious.

@@<h3><b>Key Note 2:</b></h3>

Curiosity-driven learning, which is a one of the core components of narrative design, turns out to be particularly beneficial in the field of education. One way of releasing its full potential is to teach children by letting them play educational games (aka "edutainment").

<font color="#707070"><b>Related quote from the article:</b></font>

Basically, the same cognitive mechanism that I had experienced ten years earlier within the academics also permeated the context of education.

They who believed games were bad or a hinder to formal schoolwork did not see what the children that played actually did. From my cognitive perspective on learning, I could see how the children that played were involved in highly advanced cognitive activities by setting up strategies, reasoning, making decisions, making choices, and collaborating.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Key Note 3:</b></h3>

A school often fails to teach children effectively, due to the absense of easy-to-understand goals. Since the way a game works closely matches the way our society works (Simulation games such as "SimCity" and "Capitalism 2" are obvious examples), games can play a major role in education as long as they provide children with a set of clear goals as well as clues to achieve them.
