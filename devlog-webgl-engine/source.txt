[First Screenshot of the Engine] September 14, 2023

This is a game engine I am developing these days for upcoming games. It runs on any web browser, and is based on pure WebGL (No graphics engine such as Pixi.js or Three.js). The code architecture is based on ECS (Entity Component System), so the whole engine is highly scalable and modular.

[A Video Footage] September 24, 2023

This is a video footage of the game engine I'm developing these days, which is based on pure WebGL and pure ECS.
Rudimentary graphics and physics systems are now up and running, and a framework for contriving sophisticated gameplay mechanics is currently under construction.
