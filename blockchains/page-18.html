<p>(On Legitimacy of Blockchains - 18)</p>
<p>The whole point of leveraging the idea of P2E (Play to Earn) as the primary means of maintaining a state of consensus is to ensure that the blockchain's protocol is so unfathomably complex, that it is virtually impossible for even a highly sophisticated general-purpose AI system to exploit in order to get ahold of unfair advantage.</p>
<p>For ease of conveying the subtle beauty of the technology behind this, please let me explain the concept based on a slightly metaphorical analogy. Suppose that there is a blockchain which is being operated by a unique type of PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism in a sense that it assures the presence of a node's computational work not by the fact that it has found a special input value to a cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA256) which yields an output value with a special binary pattern, but by the fact that it has discovered a sequence of player inputs inside the game of chess which yields a specific result. Whenever a transaction gets issued, for instance, it can create a round of chess in which one of the virtual players generates a sequence of moves that are pseudo-randomly determined by the transaction's hash code. As soon as the game gets broadcasted throughout the network, miners can competitively try to come up with a sequence of moves of the opponent player which results in the opponent's victory. Anyone who first succeeds in doing so will receive the mining reward.</p>
<p>Now, of course, such a mining rule is easily exploitable by any software that is capable of traversing the game's tree of possibilities and quickly discovering one of its branches that leads to the win-condition. This is because the game of chess is merely a set of logical rules which do not change at all, which means the shape of the game's possibility space will never undergo any modification. It must be fairly easy for a computer, then, to find an optimal path upon the surface of such a static landscape.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine that there is yet another blockchain in which the mining logic operates not on a simple game with a collection of fixed rules (like chess), but on a multiplayer sandbox game in which the rules themselves can be periodically amended as a result of virtual votes being cast by its players. A PoW algorithm which runs upon such a dynamic system must be orders of magnitude more resilient to hackers than a static one because its possibility space is a fluid-like surface whose control points fluctuate at random moments in time due to random actions triggered by its human participants. Even the most advanced machine-learning program cannot decode the nature of such a living galaxy of chaos, governed by countless human souls each of which is a indecipherable body of complexity in its own right.</p>
