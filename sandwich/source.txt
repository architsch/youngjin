@@<h3><b>Means of Combination</b></h3>

In order to understand the basics of sandwich engineering, one must first learn how a sandwich should be defined. A sandwich is the result of combining the following sequence of things and stacking them together:

#$
(1) A piece of bread, and
(2) Something which goes inside the sandwich, and
(3) Another piece of bread.
#$

Graphically speaking, this kind of composition can be depicted in the form of the diagram shown below.

<002>

What this image tells us is pretty straightforward. First of all, it asks the question, "What is a sandwich?" Then, it proceeds to claim (with the help of an arrow) that a sandwich is the result of combining a piece of bread (i.e. "Bread"), something which goes in between (i.e. "..."), and another piece of bread (i.e. "Bread").

In other words, the diagram states that we can make a sandwich by putting a bread AND something else AND another bread together in the same place. This process of combining multiple things into a single composite object (in this case, a sandwich) can be achieved by joining these three ingredients with the word "AND".

One should also be able to define a more specific type of sandwich. For example, a "ham sandwich" is a sandwich in which the middle ingredient is known to be a slice of ham.

<003>

What about a broader type of sandwich, such as "meat sandwich"? Its definition is not as specific as that of a ham sandwich because we are not exactly sure what sort of meat will be placed inside of it. In case of ambiguity like this, though, we are free to specify the ingredient as a list of options. Such a list can be denoted by the word "OR".

<004>

Here, we have two major constructs in our grammar - "AND" and "OR". Whenever we put multiple things together and let them coexist, we use the word "AND". Whenever we put only one among the multitude of things available, we use the word "OR".

@@<h3><b>Means of Abstraction</b></h3>

The problem with the above illustration, though, is that it is now starting to look a bit messy. It contains far too many arrows and words, and thus it is quite difficult for us to grasp what is going on in the picture. Therefore, it is important for us to split each part of the sandwich and turn it into its own encapsulated definition. This is our first step toward abstraction.

Let us revisit the definition of "meat sandwich". Instead of listing all the alternatives when describing the "meat" ingredient (such as ham, bacon, etc), we may as well simply put the word "meat" in the place where the chosen piece of meat will be inserted.

<005>

If anyone asks what the word "meat" is supposed to represent, we will then present him with the full definition of the word "meat", which is shown below.

<006>

The key point here is that we are deferring our explanation of the word "meat" up until the moment at which it is being asked.

In the same vein, one may also treat the word "bread" as an abstract concept by endowing it with an encapsulated definition. For instance, one could define "bread" as a selection of one of the following choices: "bun", "toast", "biscuit", or "English muffin". This makes sense because every one of them can be classified as "bread".

<007>

If you fully expand our definition of "meat sandwich" by replacing all of its abstract components with their full definitions, then, you will see something like this:

<008>

As you can tell, this diagram looks a bit too bloated. It contains too many details, so it is neither easy to draw nor easy to read. This is why we ought to abstract out some of its parts to keep things simple.

Abstraction can be done on multiple levels as well. For example, nothing prevents us from turning "sausage" into its own abstract definition, such as the one displayed below.

<009>

This will let us replace the "sausage" part of the definition of meat with the listing of different types of sausages.

<010>

... which, in turn, will imply that the full definition of "meat sandwich" should look something like this:

<011>

Here, "meat" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich (in general), and "sausage" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich as soon as we decided to put a sausage in it. These are two different levels of abstraction, and they unwrap themselves one by one, as we specify our choices of ingredients.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Extreme Forms of Abstraction</b></h3>

As we keep stretching this kind of reasoning, we will eventually find ourselves reaching the most extreme edge cases in which the idea of infinity is involved. There are two of them - one which represents the concept of "anything", and the other one which represents the concept of "everything".

<012>

Whenever someone says "anything", he is referring to any one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "OR" relation among the infinity of things.

Whenever someone says "everything", he is referring to every one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "AND" relation among the infinity of things.

With these two ends of the spectrum in mind, we should be able to imagine a "sandwich" as an object which comprises two pieces of bread and "anything" between them.

<013>

And of course, this "anything" is an abstract entity which defines itself as an arbitrary choice among infinitely many options.

<014>

A sandwich is a sandwich as long as there is anything between two pieces of bread, and we do not care what it is; it could be a piece of meat, vegetable, mashed potato, glass, metal, antimatter, black hole, or whatever. There are infinitely many choices available, which makes "anything" the most general form of existence we are ever able to define.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taxonomy of Sandwiches</b></h3>

What we can learn from the above example is the fact that abstraction comes in different degrees of generalization. Some forms of abstraction are either more general or more concrete than others.

For example, "sandwich" is the most general kind of all sandwiches because its definition allows us to choose absolutely anything for its core ingredient. In other words, it covers the widest range of choices we can ever imagine.

"Meat sandwich", on the other hand, is less general than "sandwich" because the range of choices of its core ingredient is more restricted. Instead of just "anything", we are forced to choose something which is able to be classified as "meat".

"Ham sandwich" is even less general than "meat sandwich" because its range of choices is way more restricted. Instead of enjoying the freedom of choosing any type of meat, we are forced to choose a slice of ham as its core ingredient.

<015>

In the context of set theory, we should be able to arrange the aforementioned three categories of sandwich as a sequence of subset relations. Here, "meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter.

<016>

Each of these subset relations, in a way, can be considered a categorical branch in the taxonomy of sandwiches.

From a graphical point of view, it should be fairly straightforward to construct the family tree of sandwiches in terms of such branches.

<017>

As you get closer to the tree's root, you will encounter more and more general categories of sandwich. As you get closer to the tree's individual leaves, you will encounter more and more specific categories of sandwich.

@@<h3><b>Composition</b></h3>

What makes a good sandwich?

This is perhaps one of the most important questions which have ever been asked in the field of culinary arts. Even the most experienced gastronomers, who have spent their entire lifetime exploring the nature of sandwiches in their extraterrestrial kitchens, struggle to answer it with a sufficient degree of confidence.

No one, howerver, would deny that composition plays a central role in the making of a high-quality sandwich.

A sandwich comes into existence the very moment we compose its ingredients in the form of a stack. We pile a number of things from bottom to top, and if the order and types of these things are appropriate, we will be able to define the resulting stack as a "sandwich".

<001>

And the secret of designing a great sandwich belongs to the way in which the individual elements of the stack are being chosen.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Composition from a Taxonomical Viewpoint</b></h3>

In order to understand what are good sandwiches (as opposed to bad sandwiches), we must first clarify the ways in which they can be categorized. As you have seen in the last article, a taxonomy (i.e. family tree) of sandwiches comes in handy whenever we are attempting to classify them in a hierarchical order.

In many cases, however, a strictly hierarchical (i.e. tree-based) organization of categories does not really work. And the reason behind this is that it is perfectly feasible to contrive a sandwich by "mixing" different types of sandwiches.

Let me show you an example. The image below is the definition of a ham sandwich.

<003>

Similarly, the image below is the definition of a cheese sandwich.

<018>

Here is where things start to get interesting. What if I want to put both a slice of ham AND a slice of cheese together, and make a sandwich out of them? In that case, we will have to refer to it as a "ham & cheese sandwich". Its definition is shown below.

<019>

This graph is self-explanatory, isn't it? It is called a "ham & cheese sandwich" because it contains both ham and cheese in it.

Here is a problem, though. At which point in the hierarchy should I place this sandwich? Will it be within a subcategory of ham sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a ham sandwich), or will it be within a subcategory of cheese sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a cheese sandwich)?

Let us revisit the family tree of sandwiches to find the answer. The diagram below shows the taxonomical relationships among different types of sandwiches.

<020>

What is illustrated here is pretty straightforward. "Meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and so forth.

<021>

What about "ham & cheese sandwich"? First of all, let me just ask a couple of questions.

Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "ham sandwich"? Oh, yes. Absolutely! It has ham in it, so it is a ham sandwich. Just because it has cheese in it does not make it a non-ham sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "ham sandwich".

Here is another question. Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "cheese sandwich"? Yes! It has cheese in it, so it is a cheese sandwich. Just because it has ham in it does not make it a non-cheese sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "cheese sandwich" as well.

<022>

So, there we have it. The graph can no longer be called a "family tree" (because it is not a tree anymore), and it is no longer purely hierarchical. Nevertheless, we are able to tell that this sort of representation does accurately reflect the nature of mix-and-match among different sandwich types.

<023>

From a set theory point of view, one can say that "ham & cheese sandwich" belongs to the intersection between "ham sandwich" and "cheese sandwich". The reason is that it is both a ham sandwich AND a cheese sandwich at the same time.

Here is a slightly different way of looking at the same subject. A "ham sandwich" only has ham in it, and a "cheese sandwich" only has cheese in it. If you put these two ingredients together inside the same sandwich (by putting them under the same "AND" relation), you will get a "ham & cheese sandwich".

<024>

The pattern we are seeing here curiously resembles the "OR" pattern we saw in the last article. Previously, I have demonstrated that the more choices of ingredient a sandwich has, the more general (i.e. broader) it gets when it comes to categorizing it in a hierarchy.

<025>

The "AND" equivalent of this phenomenon can be depicted in a similar fashion. Here, combining more and more ingredients in one place will put the sandwich into a denser and denser intersection of sandwich types.

<026>

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Sandwich Abstraction Layers</b></h3>

The mix-and-match sort of combination can happen across multiple layers of abstraction as well. For example, nothing prohibits us from stacking "any type of meat" upon a slice of ham, putting this semi-generic pair of ingredients between a pair of bread pieces, and referring to the whole thing as a "ham & meat sandwich".

<027>

This, of course, contains its own expandable bundle of details because the word "meat" suggests a multitude of choices.

<028>

What is interesting is that we are able to compose things that are already results of their own compositions.

Suppose that I decided to put the ingredients of a "ham & cheese sandwich" on top of the ingredients of a "ham & meat sandwich". The resulting product, then, will be called a "ham & meat & ham & cheese sandwich" (or "HMHC sandwich" for short).

<029>

If we graphically depict the hierarchical relationships among the sandwich types introduced so far, we will obtain a diagram which looks like this:

<030>

Notice that the "hierarchy" of sandwiches is no longer a tree; it is more of a generic graph, whose branches not only diverge but also converge.

What you are seeing is an example of the so-called "abstraction layers", where upper layers contain relatively generic sandwiches and lower layers contain relatively specific sandwiches.

<031>

Each layer is connected to its neighboring layers by means of either divergence (i.e. choice of ingredients) or convergence (i.e. composition of ingredients), or both.

As a result, what we are seeing is a vast, intertwined fabric of sandwiches. Some of them are often preferred over others, depending on how harmonious their ingredients are.

For example, it is not hard to expect that a "bacon cheese sandwich" is much more appetizing than, say, a "steamed beans and mashed potato sandwich".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Edges of the Fabric</b></h3>

There are edge cases beyond which the fabric is no longer capable of extending itself, though.

Remember that, in the last article, I mentioned that there are two extreme scenarios called "anything" and "everything", in which the former represents the infinite choice of ingredients, while the latter represents the coexistence of every ingredient?

<012>

These two extreme cases can be thought of as the topmost and bottommost tips of the fabric, respectively.

At the topmost is the so-called "sandwich", which is just a shorthand for "anything sandwich". At the bottommost is the "everything sandwich", which is a sandwich containing the entire universe as its core ingredient.

<032>

The "anything sandwich" is the ancestor of all sandwiches; it is the ultimate birthplace in which literally anything may potentially fill up the space between the two pieces of bread. The "everything sandwich", on the other hand, is the composition of all types of sandwiches we can ever imagine.
