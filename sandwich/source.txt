<001>

Sandwich Engineering is one of the hottest research topics in today's world. Every tech influencer on social media has been talking about it, and it is now an indisputable fact that if you do not learn how to make a sandwich, your job will soon be replaced by the world's most professional sandwich makers.

So, stay tuned and do not miss out this great opportunity. The future belongs to those who know how to leverage the full power of sandwiches; they are the ones who will dominate the tech industry within the next couple of years. Sandwich engineering is the future, and those who recognize its potential are the ones who will lead this new era of groundbreaking innovation.

This series will present you with an overview of this brand new field of study called "Sandwich Engineering", and how it is going to revolutionize the industry, offer cutting-edge solutions to startups, help passionate individuals succeed, achieve world peace, save our planet, make everything diverse, fulfilling, mindful, sustainable, and... whatever.

@@<h3><b>Means of Combination</b></h3>

In order to understand the basics of sandwich engineering, one must first learn how a sandwich should be defined. A sandwich is the result of combining the following sequence of things and stacking them together:

#$
(1) A piece of bread, and
(2) Something which goes inside the sandwich, and
(3) Another piece of bread.
#$

Graphically speaking, this kind of composition can be depicted in the form of the diagram shown below.

<002>

What this image tells us is pretty straightforward. First of all, it asks the question, "What is a sandwich?" Then, it proceeds to claim (with the help of an arrow) that a sandwich is the result of combining a piece of bread (i.e. "Bread"), something which goes in between (i.e. "..."), and another piece of bread (i.e. "Bread").

In other words, the diagram states that we can make a sandwich by putting a bread AND something else AND another bread together in the same place. This process of combining multiple things into a single composite object (in this case, a sandwich) can be achieved by joining these three ingredients with the word "AND".

One should also be able to define a more specific type of sandwich. For example, a "ham sandwich" is a sandwich in which the middle ingredient is known to be a slice of ham.

<003>

What about a broader type of sandwich, such as "meat sandwich"? Its definition is not as specific as that of a ham sandwich because we are not exactly sure what sort of meat will be placed inside of it. In case of ambiguity like this, though, we are free to specify the ingredient as a list of options. Such a list can be denoted by the word "OR".

<004>

Here, we have two major constructs in our grammar - "AND" and "OR". Whenever we put multiple things together and let them coexist, we use the word "AND". Whenever we put only one among the multitude of things available, we use the word "OR".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Means of Abstraction</b></h3>

The problem with the above illustration, though, is that it is now starting to look a bit messy. It contains far too many arrows and words, and thus it is quite difficult for us to grasp what is going on in the picture. Therefore, it is important for us to split each part of the sandwich and turn it into its own encapsulated definition. This is our first step toward abstraction.

Let us revisit the definition of "meat sandwich". Instead of listing all the alternatives when describing the "meat" ingredient (such as ham, bacon, etc), we may as well simply put the word "meat" in the place where the chosen piece of meat will be inserted.

<005>

If anyone asks what the word "meat" is supposed to represent, we will then present him with the full definition of the word "meat", which is shown below.

<006>

The key point here is that we are deferring our explanation of the word "meat" up until the moment at which it is being asked.

In the same vein, one may also treat the word "bread" as an abstract concept by endowing it with an encapsulated definition. For instance, one could define "bread" as a selection of one of the following choices: "bun", "toast", "biscuit", or "English muffin". This makes sense because every one of them can be classified as "bread".

<007>

If you fully expand our definition of "meat sandwich" by replacing all of its abstract components with their full definitions, then, you will see something like this:

<008>

As you can tell, this diagram looks a bit too bloated. It contains too many details, so it is neither easy to draw nor easy to read. This is why we ought to abstract out some of its parts to keep things simple.

Abstraction can be done on multiple levels as well. For example, nothing prevents us from turning "sausage" into its own abstract definition, such as the one displayed below.

<009>

This will let us replace the "sausage" part of the definition of meat with the listing of different types of sausages.

<010>

... which, in turn, will imply that the full definition of "meat sandwich" should look something like this:

<011>

Here, "meat" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich (in general), and "sausage" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich as soon as we decided to put a sausage in it. These are two different levels of abstraction, and they unwrap themselves one by one, as we specify our choices of ingredients.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Extreme Forms of Abstraction</b></h3>

As we keep stretching this kind of reasoning, we will eventually find ourselves reaching the most extreme edge cases in which the idea of infinity is involved. There are two of them - one which represents the concept of "anything", and the other one which represents the concept of "everything".

<012>

Whenever someone says "anything", he is referring to any one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "OR" relation among the infinity of things.

Whenever someone says "everything", he is referring to every one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "AND" relation among the infinity of things.

With these two ends of the spectrum in mind, we should be able to imagine a "sandwich" as an object which comprises two pieces of bread and "anything" between them.

<013>

And of course, this "anything" is an abstract entity which defines itself as an arbitrary choice among infinitely many options.

<014>

A sandwich is a sandwich as long as there is anything between two pieces of bread, and we do not care what it is; it could be a piece of meat, vegetable, mashed potato, glass, metal, antimatter, black hole, or whatever. There are infinitely many choices available, which makes "anything" the most general form of existence we are ever able to define.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taxonomy of Sandwiches</b></h3>

What we can learn from the above example is the fact that abstraction comes in different degrees of generalization. Some forms of abstraction are either more general or more concrete than others.

For example, "sandwich" is the most general kind of all sandwiches because its definition allows us to choose absolutely anything for its core ingredient. In other words, it covers the widest range of choices we can ever imagine.

"Meat sandwich", on the other hand, is less general than "sandwich" because the range of choices of its core ingredient is more restricted. Instead of just "anything", we are forced to choose something which is able to be classified as "meat".

"Ham sandwich" is even less general than "meat sandwich" because its range of choices is way more restricted. Instead of enjoying the freedom of choosing any type of meat, we are forced to choose a slice of ham as its core ingredient.

<015>

In the context of set theory, we should be able to arrange the aforementioned three categories of sandwich as a sequence of subset relations. Here, "meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter.

<016>

Each of these subset relations, in a way, can be considered a categorical branch in the taxonomy of sandwiches.

From a graphical point of view, it should be fairly straightforward to construct the family tree of sandwiches in terms of such branches.

<017>

As you get closer to the tree's root, you will encounter more and more general categories of sandwich. As you get closer to the tree's individual leaves, you will encounter more and more specific categories of sandwich.

What makes a good sandwich?

This is perhaps one of the most important questions which have ever been asked in the field of culinary arts. Even the most experienced gastronomers, who have spent their entire lifetime exploring the nature of sandwiches in their extraterrestrial kitchens, struggle to answer it with a sufficient degree of confidence.

No one, however, would deny that composition plays a central role in the making of a high-quality sandwich.

A sandwich comes into existence the very moment we compose its ingredients in the form of a stack. We pile a number of things from bottom to top, and if the order and types of these things are appropriate, we will be able to define the resulting stack as a "sandwich".

<001>

And the secret of designing a great sandwich belongs to the way in which the individual elements of the stack are being chosen.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Composition from a Taxonomical Viewpoint</b></h3>

In order to understand what are good sandwiches (as opposed to bad sandwiches), we must first clarify the ways in which they can be categorized. As you have seen in the last article, a taxonomy (i.e. family tree) of sandwiches comes in handy whenever we are attempting to classify them in a hierarchical order.

In many cases, however, a strictly hierarchical (i.e. tree-based) organization of categories does not really work. And the reason behind this is that it is perfectly feasible to contrive a sandwich by "mixing" different types of sandwiches.

Let me show you an example. The image below is the definition of a ham sandwich.

<003>

Similarly, the image below is the definition of a cheese sandwich.

<018>

Here is where things start to get interesting. What if I want to put both a slice of ham AND a slice of cheese together, and make a sandwich out of them? In that case, we will have to refer to it as a "ham & cheese sandwich". Its definition is shown below.

<019>

This graph is self-explanatory, isn't it? It is called a "ham & cheese sandwich" because it contains both ham and cheese in it.

Here is a problem, though. At which point in the hierarchy should I place this sandwich? Will it be within a subcategory of ham sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a ham sandwich), or will it be within a subcategory of cheese sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a cheese sandwich)?

Let us revisit the family tree of sandwiches to find the answer. The diagram below shows the taxonomical relationships among different types of sandwiches.

<020>

What is illustrated here is pretty straightforward. "Meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and so forth.

<021>

What about "ham & cheese sandwich"? First of all, let me just ask a couple of questions.

Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "ham sandwich"? Oh, yes. Absolutely! It has ham in it, so it is a ham sandwich. Just because it has cheese in it does not make it a non-ham sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "ham sandwich".

Here is another question. Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "cheese sandwich"? Yes! It has cheese in it, so it is a cheese sandwich. Just because it has ham in it does not make it a non-cheese sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "cheese sandwich" as well.

<022>

So, there we have it. The graph can no longer be called a "family tree" (because it is not a tree anymore), and it is no longer purely hierarchical. Nevertheless, we are able to tell that this sort of representation does accurately reflect the nature of mix-and-match among different sandwich types.

<023>

From a set theory point of view, one can say that "ham & cheese sandwich" belongs to the intersection between "ham sandwich" and "cheese sandwich". The reason is that it is both a ham sandwich AND a cheese sandwich at the same time.

Here is a slightly different way of looking at the same subject. A "ham sandwich" only has ham in it, and a "cheese sandwich" only has cheese in it. If you put these two ingredients together inside the same sandwich (by putting them under the same "AND" relation), you will get a "ham & cheese sandwich".

<024>

The pattern we are seeing here curiously resembles the "OR" pattern we saw in the last article. Previously, I have demonstrated that the more choices of ingredient a sandwich has, the more general (i.e. broader) it gets when it comes to categorizing it in a hierarchy.

<025>

The "AND" equivalent of this phenomenon can be depicted in a similar fashion. Here, combining more and more ingredients in one place will put the sandwich into a denser and denser intersection of sandwich types.

<026>

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Sandwich Abstraction Layers</b></h3>

The mix-and-match sort of combination can happen across multiple layers of abstraction as well. For example, nothing prohibits us from stacking "any type of meat" upon a slice of ham, putting this semi-generic pair of ingredients between a pair of bread pieces, and referring to the whole thing as a "ham & meat sandwich".

<027>

This, of course, contains its own expandable bundle of details because the word "meat" suggests a multitude of choices.

<028>

What is interesting is that we are able to compose things that are already results of their own compositions.

Suppose that I decided to put the ingredients of a "ham & cheese sandwich" on top of the ingredients of a "ham & meat sandwich". The resulting product, then, will be called a "ham & meat & ham & cheese sandwich" (or "HMHC sandwich" for short).

<029>

If we graphically depict the hierarchical relationships among the sandwich types introduced so far, we will obtain a diagram which looks like this:

<030>

Notice that the "hierarchy" of sandwiches is no longer a tree; it is more of a generic graph, whose branches not only diverge but also converge.

What you are seeing is an example of the so-called "abstraction layers", where upper layers contain relatively generic sandwiches and lower layers contain relatively specific sandwiches.

<031>

Each layer is connected to its neighboring layers by means of either divergence (i.e. choice of ingredients) or convergence (i.e. composition of ingredients), or both.

As a result, what we are seeing is a vast, intertwined fabric of sandwiches. Some of them are often preferred over others, depending on how harmonious their ingredients are.

For example, it is not hard to expect that a "bacon cheese sandwich" is much more appetizing than, say, a "steamed beans and mashed potato sandwich".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Edges of the Fabric</b></h3>

There are edge cases beyond which the fabric is no longer capable of extending itself, though.

Remember that, in the last article, I mentioned that there are two extreme scenarios called "anything" and "everything", in which the former represents the infinite choice of ingredients, while the latter represents the coexistence of every ingredient?

<012>

These two extreme cases can be thought of as the topmost and bottommost tips of the fabric, respectively.

At the topmost is the so-called "sandwich", which is just a shorthand for "anything sandwich". At the bottommost is the "everything sandwich", which is a sandwich containing the entire universe as its core ingredient.

<032>

The "anything sandwich" is the ancestor of all sandwiches; it is the ultimate birthplace in which literally anything may potentially fill up the space between the two pieces of bread. The "everything sandwich", on the other hand, is the composition of all types of sandwiches we can ever imagine.

@@<h3><b>Evaluation of a Sandwich</b></h3>

How to measure the quality of a sandwich?

It really depends on one's personal taste, but we can still talk about some of the commonly available methodologies. Being able to evaluate the overall quality of a sandwich is a necessary skill to have, in order to become a legendary sandwich craftsman.

<033>

A truly appetizing sandwich must obey the following two principles:

#$
(1) It consists of tasty ingredients.
(2) These ingredients are stacked in a tasty order.
#$

The word "tasty" may sound a bit too subjective, and indeed it is. However, it will appear to be far more sensible if you just interpret it as "generally tasty" or, in other words, "considered tasty by the average eater".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taste Scores</b></h3>

Let us begin with the first principle.

The first step toward the making of a highly edible sandwich is to gather ingredients which can be appreciated even when we eat each of them individually. This means that it is crucial for us to first evaluate the quality of each ingredient and assign a number to it (denoting its degree of tastiness). We may refer to this number as the ingredient's "taste score".

<034>

Since a sandwich is a combination of multiple ingredients, a straightforward way of judging its quality is to first evaluate the scores of its individual components and then sum them all up.

Let me start with a simple example. The following image is the anatomy of a cheese sandwich which was showcased before.

<018>

How to calculate its overall score? Oh, it may seem daunting at first, but the problem is not complicated at all as long as you put some thought to it. Let us first assign the appropriate score to each of the sandwich's ingredients, and then take the sum of them (denoted by the "+" sign).

<035>

The result of such computation could be used to represent the overall taste score of the cheese sandwich. Why? Because a cheese sandwich is basically just the "sum" of its three constituents - lower bread, cheese, and upper bread. If we know their individual scores, therefore, it should make sense to assume that the score of the whole sandwich is their sum.

<036>

Assuming that the score of each piece of bread is 7 and the score of each slice of cheese is 10, we may conclude that the score of the cheese sandwich is 7 + 10 + 7 = 24.

<037>

All right, here is the next example. How shall we compute the taste score of a sausage sandwich?

<038>

Here, we will assume that the sausage is an abstract item; that is, the word "sausage" is simply a generic term which is being used to indicate one of the 3 possible choices - chicken sausage, pork sausage, and beef sausage.

<039>

This means that, in order to figure out the taste score of the "sausage" part of the sandwich, we must first know how to determine the score of something uncertain (i.e. something which comes with multiple choices).

This too, however, is not a headache at all. Assuming that each choice has an equal chance of being picked up, we can claim from a statistical point of view that the most expected score of a randomly selected sausage is simply the average score of its 3 potential choices (i.e. chicken, pork, or beef).

<040>

The term "avg" is just a shorthand for "average", by the way. If we suppose that the scores of the 3 aforementioned types of sausages are 13, 14, and 15, respectively, we will be able to conclude that the overall score of the "sausage" in our context is the average of 13, 14, and 15.

<041>

This score calculation procedure can substitute the "sausage" part of the sausage sandwich, yielding the following arithmetic scheme:

<042>

If we compute the "avg" part, we will get this:

<043>

... which eventually simplifies down to a single number, representing the sausage sandwich's overall score (shown below).

<044>

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Pitfalls of Summation</b></h3>

Okay, you might have noticed that there is something fishy in here. It is the fact that, if we are to stick to the above methodology and refuse further elaboration on how scores are to be derived, we will soon be forced to reach the conclusion that a sandwich with more ingredients should score higher than those with fewer ingredients.

This, of course, is not desirable. Unless you are a mere glutton whose only interest is to eat as much as possible, you will agree that packing more ingredients does not necessarily yield a better sandwich.

Let us take a cheese sandwich as an example. We know that it has a single slice of cheese in it, so it makes sense to simply add the score of the cheese to the sandwich's total score.

Since cheese is a highly favored ingredient (because it is tasty), let us add an additional slice of cheese to the sandwich and make it a "double-cheese sandwich".

<045>

If we are to follow the scoring method established so far, we will have to say that adding this additional slice of cheese will basically double the cheese-score of the sandwich. This feels a bit excessive, but, let us move on anyways.

Next, I will try adding yet another slice of cheese to this double-cheese sandwich and turn it into a "triple-cheese sandwich". What will the new score be?

<046>

Of course, it will be even higher than that of the double-cheese sandwich, simply because there are more slices of cheese in this case.

The problem with this approach is that it just keeps incrementing the score as we add more and more ingredients.

What if we put 4 slices of cheese instead of 3? What about 5, 6, 7, or even 100 slices of cheese? Should a hundred-cheese sandwich score about 100 times higher than a single-cheese sandwich? Probably not. No one wants to eat a sandwich with a hundred slices of cheese in it.

Therefore, a mere summation of the individual ingredient scores does not accurately reflect the sandwich's overall score.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Relational Taste Scores</b></h3>

So, what's the solution? First off, we definitely need a better way to tell how good a sandwich is. Let us revisit the previous cheese sandwich example.

<018>

Just by looking at the ingredients, I am able to tell that it should score pretty high because it has cheese in it, yet not "too" high because it has cheese only and nothing else. A slice of ham would have made it a lot more appetizing.

But the question is, will this sandwich become more appetizing if I add a totally random thing as an extra ingredient, such as apple jam?

<047>

In my opinion, both a "cheese sandwich" and an "apple jam sandwich" deserve high scores, while a sandwich which contains both cheese AND apple jam in it does not.

The reason behind this is that cheese and apple jam usually do not pair up well. Some people might find it particularly attractive, but I do not believe that such appetite is commonplace (Consider "mint chocolate" as an example).

The main problem here is that when two things are combined, their values do not necessarily add up. Depending on how harmonious they are when put together, they may introduce either synergy or dissonance.

Take a look at the following example here, which shows the anatomy of a PB&J (Peanut Butter & Jelly) sandwich.

<048>

Compare this with the "cheese & apple jam sandwich" we saw before. If you are equipped with a decent sense of taste, you should probably agree that the PB&J sandwich deserves a much higher score than the other one. Peanut butter and jelly is a way better choice of combination than the one between cheese and apple jam.

This sort of reasoning leads us to the conclusion that, when evaluating a sandwich, we must take into account not only the scores of the individual ingredients, but also the scores of their relations.

Here is an alternative scoring method.

<049>

As you can tell from the pictures above, I am now assigning scores to pairs of neighboring items, not the items themselves (Notice that the pairing of peanut butter and jelly produces a higher score than that of cheese and apple jam). Then, I am simply taking their average to obtain the overall score of the sandwich.

This, too, has its own flaws. For instance, it does not consider cases in which we are duplicating the same thing a bunch of times (e.g. 100 cheese slices).

Nevertheless, what is shown above is an improvement over the previous methodology, and we are free to keep rectifying it. For now, though, I will pause here and move on to other important topics.

@@<h3><b>Sandwich Transformation</b></h3>

If we want to understand the way in which a sandwich is being made, we should first learn how one type of sandwich can be transformed into another. Let us revisit our cheese sandwich example to see what I mean by this.

<018>

As you can tell from the picture above, a cheese sandwich is the result of making a stack out of a piece of bread, a slice of cheese, and another piece of bread. Suppose that we have made this sandwich already. In which ways will we be able to modify it?

Here is a simple example. Let us take off the top piece of bread. This will change this "cheese sandwich" into a "cheese open sandwich".

<051>

It can no longer be just called "sandwich"; instead, it is now required to be called an "open sandwich" because its upper portion is not being closed by a piece of bread.

This is an example of a transformation. Removing the topmost item from the stack turned our cheese sandwich into a "cheese open sandwich". Such a process can be expressed as an arrow (see the diagram below).

<052>

The opposite scenario is equally feasible. We can add back the piece of bread to the top of the "cheese open sandwich", thereby recovering our original cheese sandwich.

<053>

Here is another example. What if we wish to convert our cheese sandwich into a "double-cheese sandwich" instead, by putting an extra slice of cheese in it?

<054>

This one is a bit tricky. Previously, we were simply dealing with the uppermost part of the sandwich, so every related action could take place immediately. In contrast, we cannot convert our cheese sandwich into a "double-cheese sandwcih" just by fiddling with its topmost ingredient. The following image shows what needs to be achieved.

<055>

We are trying to put a slice of cheese in between the existing cheese and the bread which sits on top of it. Can we do this by removing the top bread? No, because it will merely turn the sandwich into an open sandwich. What about stacking cheese on top of the sandwich? No, because it will make the top bread be "stuck" between the two slices of cheese.

The solution must be pretty simple as long as we think of it as a multi-step procedure. First, we just take out the top bread to expose the cheese. Next, we add an extra slice of cheese on top of the existing cheese. Finally, we put back the top piece of bread.

<056>

These three steps, when executed in the right order, will transform the cheese sandwich into a "double-cheese sandwich".

The diagram below is a more comprehensive illustration of what can happen between a "cheese sandwich" and a "double-cheese sandwich". Note that there are two intermediate states between the former and the latter.

<057>

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Reversible VS Irreversible</b></h3>

There are processes, however, which cannot be reverted. Imagine that we are trying to turn a cheese sandwich into a "cheese & hot sauce sandwich" - that is, a sandwich made up of a slice of cheese and a bit of hot sauce spread upon it. The following image shows the steps required to carry out this job.

<058>

It is almost identical to the list of steps we saw before. The only difference is that, instead of putting an extra slice of cheese, we just put some hot sauce in it.

But be careful! The process of putting hot sauce is irreversible because it is in a liquid form. Take a look at a more comprehensive diagram which is shown below.

<059>

Here, you can clearly see that there is no arrow which lets you convert the "cheese & hot sauce open sandwich" back to "cheese open sandwich". This implies that once you put hot sauce on your "cheese open sandwich" and turn it into a "cheese & hot sauce open sandwich", you are unable to turn it back to "cheese open sandwich" by simply taking out the hot sauce (because you can't).

This make sense, doesn't it? Hot sauce is made of gooey liquid, so we cannot just grab it and throw it away once it sticks to the surface of the cheese.

In general, we should be able to say that each transformation is either reversible or irreversible.

It is "reversible" when it comes with a pair of arrows (creating a two-way road). In contrast, it is "irreversible" when it comes with only a single arrow (creating a one-way road).

@@<h3><b>Building a Sandwich from Scratch</b></h3>

Let us push these minor details aside, and focus on what is of utmost importance - making a sandwich from scratch.

Suppose we are facing an empty table. What do we have to do in order to come up with something which can be referred to as a "sandwich"? One thing that is for sure is that we need to prepare some ingredients, and then stack them one by one.

First of all, we know that the bottommost part of a sandwich is always a piece of bread. So let us start by putting a piece of bread on the table.

<061>

This single piece can technically be called an "empty open sandwich"; it is "open" because its top is not closed by another piece of bread, and it is "empty" because there is nothing above the bottom piece of bread.

If we put another piece of bread on top of it, it will become a (closed) sandwich. Since there will be nothing between the two pieces of bread, however, it will be called an "empty sandwich"; it is no longer "open", but it is still "empty".

<062>

What if we put yet another piece of bread on top of this "empty sandwich"? Oh, in this case, our sandwich will no longer be empty because its inside will be filled with something. This "something", though, is just a piece of bread, so we will have to refer to the whole thing as a "bread sandwich".

This kind of naming should make sense. When there is ham between two pieces of bread, we call it a "ham sandwich". And when there is cheese between two pieces of bread, we call it a "cheese sandwich". So, if there is bread between two pieces of bread, we ought to call it a "bread sandwich".

The series of stacking processes we have carried out so far can be summarized as the ones shown below.

<064>

First, we started from nothing. We added a piece of bread on top of this "nothing" and turned it into an "empty open sandwich". We then added another piece of bread on top of it to turn it into an "empty sandwich", and then another piece of bread on top of it to turn it into a "bread sandwich".

Note that these 3 processes are all reversible because each of them has its own opposite action which reverts its effect.

@@<h3><b>Tech Tree of Sandwiches</b></h3>

If we just keep stacking pieces of bread and nothing else, we will eventually end up producing just a bunch of boring sandwiches, such as "double-bread sandwich", "triple-bread sandwich", and so on. We need something other than bread in our sandwich.

Fortunately, there are alternative ways in which a sandwich could be constructed. We've got a plethora of different choices, and bread is just one of them. On top of our first piece of bread, for example, we could have put a slice of cheese instead.

<065>

See? Here are two alternative pathways, and we are free to choose one of them. If we choose to put a piece of bread upon the existing piece of bread, we will end up with an "empty sandwich". If we choose a slice of cheese, on the other hand, we will end up with a "cheese open sandwich".

The following diagram is a more comprehensive depiction of these two choices.

<066>

We can keep expanding this "tech tree" of sandwiches, which contains innumerable choices (branches) from which all sorts of unique sandwich recipes are able to be conceived.

<067>

What you are seeing above is an example of a tree involving multiple variants of "cheese sandwich". It is not hard to imagine that the tree will become more and more diversified as we introduce additional ingredients such as ham, sausage, avocado, potato, etc.

@@<h3><b>Sandwich Uncertainty Principle</b></h3>

When building a sandwich from scratch, however, we often face moments of ambiguity which could be a bit annoying. And if you really want to become a master of sandwich engineering, you should understand the nature of such moments as well as how to treat them properly.

<068>

Let me give you an example. In the previous chapter, I have shown you that putting a slice of cheese on top of a single piece of bread will turn it into a "cheese open sandwich".

<069>

There is a great deal of uncertainty going on here, though. What kind of cheese do we refer to exactly, when we say: "cheese open sandwich"? There are different types of cheese, and we will never know which one we are talking about as long as we just say "cheese".

For instance, suppose that there are 3 types of cheese available - Provolone, Gouda, and Cheddar. This will imply that whenever we say the word "cheese", we are indicating one of these 3 types (not all of them, but one).

<070>

This means that we cannot just put "cheese" on top of a piece of bread, without specifying its type. "Cheese" is an abstract concept. It is not a tangible object which we can touch, smell, or eat. Rather, it is a general category of things which can be classified as "cheese".

Thus, whenever we are using the word "cheese", we are merely "deciding" to put a slice of cheese to the sandwich without actually doing it (since we haven't yet determined whether this cheese should refer to Provolone, Gouda, or Cheddar).

<071>

And of course, we are free to cancel our decision if we want to.

<072>

Since "cheese" is an abstract concept, we must be able to tell that a "cheese open sandwich" is an abstract concept, too. So for example, when we say "cheese open sandwich", we know that it must be made of bread and cheese, right?

<073>

But the problem is that the cheese itself is something ambiguous; the word "cheese" alone does not tell us exactly which kind of cheese it is. Thus, the "cheese" part of this sandwich must comprise a number of alternative options (i.e. Provolone, Gouda, or Cheddar).

<074>

This sandwich is abstract (i.e. not tangible) because we have not fully specified its ingredients yet. As long as there is room for ambiguity, it cannot exist in real life.

@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Schrödinger's Cheese</b></h3>

It is only after we make specific choices to resolve all the ambiguities, that the sandwich will finally become tangible. In the example below, I chose to put a slice of Provolone cheese on top of the bread. This cleared out every bit of indeterminacy from the sandwich and turned it into something solid (i.e. non-abstract).

<075>

We can summarize the steps we have taken so far as a harmony between two types of actions - one for presenting ourselves with a set of choices, and the other one for actually making a choice out of them.

Putting a slice of Provolone cheese on top of the bread, for instance, required me to first "decide" to put a slice of cheese (which gave me access to 3 choices - Provolone, Gouda, and Cheddar), and then pick the choice called "Provolone".

<076>

And of course, these two steps are both reversible, meaning that I am able to remove the cheese from the top and turn the whole thing back to an "empty open sandwich".

@@<h3><b>Sandwich Production Line</b></h3>

A sense of confusion may arise here, though. What do we mean when we say that we "decided" to put a slice of cheese?

<071>

Whenever we "decide" to do something, we are not actually doing it. Instead, we are simply making a promise to do it in the future. This is more of a mental phenomenon, rather than something which is physically measurable. However, it is still feasible to express such a sense of promise by physical means.

Imagine that we are operating a "sandwich production line" inside a factory. There is a conveyor belt which carries stacks of sandwich ingredients. By the time they reach the end of the belt, they will transform into fully legitimate sandwiches.

<078>

Oh, but we cannot make stacks of ingredients just by carrying them on a conveyor belt. We need dispensers which will put new ingredients on top of the existing ones. In order to let our sandwiches have cheese in them, for example, we need a cheese dispenser.

<079>

As you can see, this cheese dispenser will be responsible for dropping cheese on top of bare pieces of bread that are passing by, thereby turning them into "cheese open sandwiches".

Let us suppose that a single piece of bread happened to enter the conveyor belt, above which a cheese dispenser is situated. At first, this piece of bread is obviously just an "empty open sandwich" because it is just a single piece of bread.

<080>

The moment it comes right beneath the cheese dispenser, however, it becomes a different story. Here, we know that a slice of cheese is about to be dropped on top of the piece of bread. We are not yet sure exactly what kind of cheese will come out of the dispenser, but we can at least assure that "some" cheese will come out it.

<081>

This is the very moment at which we can sense a "promise" of having a slice of cheese on top of the bread. At this point in time, therefore, this particular piece of bread should be considered a "cheese open sandwich". Although it does not have an actual slice of cheese on it yet, we know that it is about to have one soon.

And as soon as the dispenser drops an actual slice of cheese (such as Provolone), this thing called "cheese open sandwich" will transform into something tangible - that is, something which has real cheese on it (not an abstract kind of cheese).

<082>

We can map this out as a diagram, like the one shown below. A single piece of bread (aka "empty open sandwich") turns into a "cheese open sandwich" as soon as it becomes clear that a slice of cheese is about to drop on top of it, and subsequently turns into a "provolone cheese sandwich" as soon as it receives an actual slice of Provolone cheese.

<083>

And when you look at the conveyor belt as a whole, you will realize that the queue of sandwiches which continuously flow from the left to the right are undergoing a series of transformations one by one, depending on whether each of them is coming toward the cheese dispenser, going away from the cheese dispenser, or is passing right underneath it.

<084>

In a way, therefore, a conveyor belt can be thought of as a "sandwich transformer". It absorbs an incoming stream of sandwiches, transforms them one by one, and pours them out as an outgoing stream of sandwiches.

<085>

We can keep expanding this idea indefinitely. By adding yet another cheese dispenser to the belt, for example, we are able to manufacture not just single-cheese open sandwiches, but also double-cheese open sandwiches (see the image below).

<086>

What's next? Oh well, it is not so hard to imagine the sheer variety of opportunities waiting before us. We may as well introduce a "bread dispenser" and "ham dispenser" to produce "ham sandwiches", or a "bacon dispenser" to produce "bacon sandwiches", and so on.

The horizon of possibilities is endless.

@@<h3><b>Multiple Pathways</b></h3>

Suppose that we are running a sandwich factory. We are trying to manufacture sandwiches here.

Let's begin with a bread dispenser (shown in the image below). This is the very first step in the making of a sandwich. Every sandwich starts with a piece of bread.

<087>

All right. What shall we do, if we want to make a cheese sandwich?

Since a cheese sandwich is just a stack of a piece of bread, a slice of cheese, and another piece of bread, it is not so hard to imagine that lining up 3 dispensers (i.e. a bread dispenser, a cheese dispenser, and another bread dispenser) will let our conveyor belt pour out cheese sandwiches.

<088>

So far, so good. But here is the thing. What if we want to generate more than just a single type of sandwiches? Imagine that our factory is required to produce not just cheese sandwiches, but also ham sandwiches. What shall we do?

The answer is, we need to "branch out" our production line into multiple pathways. What I mean by this is that we need separate conveyor belts to be able to make different types of sandwiches.

For now, let us assume that there are two belts - one for putting slices of cheese for cheese sandwiches, and another one for putting slices of ham for ham sandwiches.

<089>

This is not the end of the story, though. Note that both of these belts are receiving bottom pieces of bread, upon which either cheese or ham could be placed. Where do these pieces of bread come from?

For sure, it is technically possible to supply bread by equipping both of these conveyor belts with their own bread dispensers.

<090>

This is a bit too wasteful from an economic point of view, however. Each machine comes with its own price (for purchase and maintenance). Also, more machines means more chance of failure in the manufacturing process. So we ought to keep the number of machines as low as possible.

The solution is pretty simple, really. We only need one bread dispenser for both of these two sandwich types, as long as we distribute the bread into two separate conveyor belts. These two belts, then, will manage to produce two types of sandwiches.

<091>

But then, of course, these sandwiches will have to have their tops closed. Otherwise, they will end up remaining as "open sandwiches", rather than regular sandwiches.

Again, a straightforward approach is to simply add a bread dispenser for cheese sandwiches, and another bread dispenser for ham sandwiches, like the ones shown below.

<092>

This will ensure that the resulting sandwiches are "sandwiches" instead of "open sandwiches". However, this is not the best solution.

Just like we do not need 2 bread dispensers for the bottom pieces of bread, we do not need 2 bread dispensers for the top pieces of bread. And the reason is that we are able to merge 2 conveyor belts into 1, just as we are able to split 1 conveyor belt into 2.

<093>

All we need to do is merge the two manufacturing lines into one. One tricky question which may arise, though, is: "How shall we arrange these two different types of sandwiches on a single belt?"

There are a multitude of ways in which they can be arranged. In our case, however, the most intuitive approach is to simply put them in an alternating manner, so that the resulting queue will look something like: [cheese, ham, cheese, ham, cheese, ham, ...].

To summarize the whole process, let me simplify our notations a bit. For example, let us suppose that an arrow denotes a conveyor belt.

<094>

Then, the full manufacturing process of both cheese and ham sandwiches can be illustrated as a neat diagram, like the one shown here:

<095>

The first production line creates a sequence of bottom pieces of bread. It then splits itself into two lines, one for adding cheese and the other one for adding ham. And then, these two lines merge back to a single line, upon which they both receive their top pieces of bread.

The result is the following sequences of sandwiches:

@@<h3><b>Package Processing</b></h3>

Imagine, though, that our factory's goal is to manufacture not just sandwiches, but lunch boxes with multiple sandwiches in them. Let's say that each of our lunch boxes is expected to have 2 sandwiches in it - a cheese sandwich and a ham sandwich. What shall we do to mass-produce it?

<097>

We probably all agree that, in order for us to pack two sandwiches in one box, we must first pack each one of them individually first. Otherwise, how shall the customer even manage to tell which ingredients belong to which sandwich? If we do not pack these 2 sandwiches separately, consumers will just look at the whole chunk and assume that it is just a Big Mac (i.e. one super thick sandwich with a bit of extra bread in the middle).

So, let us install a new equipment called "packer". A packer's job is fairly simple; it just packs stacks of ingredients which happen to be passing underneath.

<098>

Now the conveyor belt is carrying sandwiches that are individually wrapped, thereby allowing us to treat them as fully legitimate sandwiches instead of mere stacks of edible components.

The next step is to put each pair of sandwiches (i.e. a cheese sandwich and a ham sandwich) in the same spot, so that we can put them in the same lunch box. For such a purpose, I will introduce yet another type of factory equipment called "holder".

A holder is capable of holding whatever is underneath, and then dropping it after a bit of time delay. In our case, it should first grab a cheese sandwich it sees.

<099>

While it is holding the cheese sandwich, then, the ham sandwich which was moving right behind it will continue moving forward.

<100>

Soon, this ham sandwich will come right beneath the cheese sandwich which has been held above. At this point, the only thing the holder needs to do is drop the cheese sandwich, so that it will land right on top of the ham sandwich. This is how we put two sandwiches together.

<101>

And, if we let our holder repeat these two actions (i.e. "hold" and "drop") over and over again, we will see that it will effectively end up transforming the alternating sequence of cheese and ham sandwiches into another sequence in which these two types of sandwiches are put together as pairs.

<102>

Such a process is different from that of a simple dispenser (such as "cheese dispenser"), whose only job is to simply keep dropping the same ingredient over and over.

<103>

The figure below illustrates the difference between a holder and a dispenser. A holder can both hold AND drop things, which means that it is capable of transporting something from one place to another. A dispenser, on the other hand, can only introduce new elements to the system; it is incapable of fiddling with what's already been out there on the belt.

<104>

Anyways, now that we have our cheese sandwiches sitting on top of our ham sandwiches, the remaining step is to pack each of these pairs, as a whole, to prevent them from separating from each other.

<105>

The result is the sequence of lunch boxes, each of which is a pack of a (packed) cheese sandwich and a (packed) ham sandwich.

The diagram shown below is the summary of what has been demonstrated so far.

<106>

First, we started from nothing (i.e. an empty conveyor belt). Next, we laid down pieces of bread and distributed them over two separate belts (one for cheese and the other one for ham). We then recombined these 2 into a single line of open sandwiches, closed their tops, packed the results, put them together as pairs, and finally packed them to obtain lunch boxes.
