@@<h3><b>Means of Combination</b></h3>

In order to understand the basics of sandwich engineering, one must first learn how a sandwich should be defined. A sandwich is the result of combining the following sequence of things and stacking them together:

#$
(1) A piece of bread, and
(2) Something which goes inside the sandwich, and
(3) Another piece of bread.
#$

Graphically speaking, this kind of composition can be depicted in the form of the diagram shown below.

<002>

What this image tells us is pretty straightforward. First of all, it asks the question, "What is a sandwich?" Then, it proceeds to claim (with the help of an arrow) that a sandwich is the result of combining a piece of bread (i.e. "Bread"), something which goes in between (i.e. "..."), and another piece of bread (i.e. "Bread").

In other words, the diagram states that we can make a sandwich by putting a bread AND something else AND another bread together in the same place. This process of combining multiple things into a single composite object (in this case, a sandwich) can be achieved by joining these three ingredients with the word "AND".

One should also be able to define a more specific type of sandwich. For example, a "ham sandwich" is a sandwich in which the middle ingredient is known to be a slice of ham.

<003>

What about a broader type of sandwich, such as "meat sandwich"? Its definition is not as specific as that of a ham sandwich because we are not exactly sure what sort of meat will be placed inside of it. In case of ambiguity like this, though, we are free to specify the ingredient as a list of options. Such a list can be denoted by the word "OR".

<004>

Here, we have two major constructs in our grammar - "AND" and "OR". Whenever we put multiple things together and let them coexist, we use the word "AND". Whenever we put only one among the multitude of things available, we use the word "OR".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Means of Abstraction</b></h3>

The problem with the above illustration, though, is that it is now starting to look a bit messy. It contains far too many arrows and words, and thus it is quite difficult for us to grasp what is going on in the picture. Therefore, it is important for us to split each part of the sandwich and turn it into its own encapsulated definition. This is our first step toward abstraction.

Let us revisit the definition of "meat sandwich". Instead of listing all the alternatives when describing the "meat" ingredient (such as ham, bacon, etc), we may as well simply put the word "meat" in the place where the chosen piece of meat will be inserted.

<005>

If anyone asks what the word "meat" is supposed to represent, we will then present him with the full definition of the word "meat", which is shown below.

<006>

The key point here is that we are deferring our explanation of the word "meat" up until the moment at which it is being asked.

In the same vein, one may also treat the word "bread" as an abstract concept by endowing it with an encapsulated definition. For instance, one could define "bread" as a selection of one of the following choices: "bun", "toast", "biscuit", or "English muffin". This makes sense because every one of them can be classified as "bread".

<007>

If you fully expand our definition of "meat sandwich" by replacing all of its abstract components with their full definitions, then, you will see something like this:

<008>

As you can tell, this diagram looks a bit too bloated. It contains too many details, so it is neither easy to draw nor easy to read. This is why we ought to abstract out some of its parts to keep things simple.

Abstraction can be done on multiple levels as well. For example, nothing prevents us from turning "sausage" into its own abstract definition, such as the one displayed below.

<009>

This will let us replace the "sausage" part of the definition of meat with the listing of different types of sausages.

<010>

... which, in turn, will imply that the full definition of "meat sandwich" should look something like this:

<011>

Here, "meat" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich (in general), and "sausage" is the abstraction of what goes inside a meat sandwich as soon as we decided to put a sausage in it. These are two different levels of abstraction, and they unwrap themselves one by one, as we specify our choices of ingredients.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Extreme Forms of Abstraction</b></h3>

As we keep stretching this kind of reasoning, we will eventually find ourselves reaching the most extreme edge cases in which the idea of infinity is involved. There are two of them - one which represents the concept of "anything", and the other one which represents the concept of "everything".

<012>

Whenever someone says "anything", he is referring to any one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "OR" relation among the infinity of things.

Whenever someone says "everything", he is referring to every one of the infinitely many things we can ever imagine. This is the equivalent of the "AND" relation among the infinity of things.

With these two ends of the spectrum in mind, we should be able to imagine a "sandwich" as an object which comprises two pieces of bread and "anything" between them.

<013>

And of course, this "anything" is an abstract entity which defines itself as an arbitrary choice among infinitely many options.

<014>

A sandwich is a sandwich as long as there is anything between two pieces of bread, and we do not care what it is; it could be a piece of meat, vegetable, mashed potato, glass, metal, antimatter, black hole, or whatever. There are infinitely many choices available, which makes "anything" the most general form of existence we are ever able to define.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taxonomy of Sandwiches</b></h3>

What we can learn from the above example is the fact that abstraction comes in different degrees of generalization. Some forms of abstraction are either more general or more concrete than others.

For example, "sandwich" is the most general kind of all sandwiches because its definition allows us to choose absolutely anything for its core ingredient. In other words, it covers the widest range of choices we can ever imagine.

"Meat sandwich", on the other hand, is less general than "sandwich" because the range of choices of its core ingredient is more restricted. Instead of just "anything", we are forced to choose something which is able to be classified as "meat".

"Ham sandwich" is even less general than "meat sandwich" because its range of choices is way more restricted. Instead of enjoying the freedom of choosing any type of meat, we are forced to choose a slice of ham as its core ingredient.

<015>

In the context of set theory, we should be able to arrange the aforementioned three categories of sandwich as a sequence of subset relations. Here, "meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter.

<016>

Each of these subset relations, in a way, can be considered a categorical branch in the taxonomy of sandwiches.

From a graphical point of view, it should be fairly straightforward to construct the family tree of sandwiches in terms of such branches.

<017>

As you get closer to the tree's root, you will encounter more and more general categories of sandwich. As you get closer to the tree's individual leaves, you will encounter more and more specific categories of sandwich.

@@<h3><b>Composition</b></h3>

What makes a good sandwich?

This is perhaps one of the most important questions which have ever been asked in the field of culinary arts. Even the most experienced gastronomers, who have spent their entire lifetime exploring the nature of sandwiches in their extraterrestrial kitchens, struggle to answer it with a sufficient degree of confidence.

No one, however, would deny that composition plays a central role in the making of a high-quality sandwich.

A sandwich comes into existence the very moment we compose its ingredients in the form of a stack. We pile a number of things from bottom to top, and if the order and types of these things are appropriate, we will be able to define the resulting stack as a "sandwich".

<001>

And the secret of designing a great sandwich belongs to the way in which the individual elements of the stack are being chosen.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Composition from a Taxonomical Viewpoint</b></h3>

In order to understand what are good sandwiches (as opposed to bad sandwiches), we must first clarify the ways in which they can be categorized. As you have seen in the last article, a taxonomy (i.e. family tree) of sandwiches comes in handy whenever we are attempting to classify them in a hierarchical order.

In many cases, however, a strictly hierarchical (i.e. tree-based) organization of categories does not really work. And the reason behind this is that it is perfectly feasible to contrive a sandwich by "mixing" different types of sandwiches.

Let me show you an example. The image below is the definition of a ham sandwich.

<003>

Similarly, the image below is the definition of a cheese sandwich.

<018>

Here is where things start to get interesting. What if I want to put both a slice of ham AND a slice of cheese together, and make a sandwich out of them? In that case, we will have to refer to it as a "ham & cheese sandwich". Its definition is shown below.

<019>

This graph is self-explanatory, isn't it? It is called a "ham & cheese sandwich" because it contains both ham and cheese in it.

Here is a problem, though. At which point in the hierarchy should I place this sandwich? Will it be within a subcategory of ham sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a ham sandwich), or will it be within a subcategory of cheese sandwiches (because it is a more specific variant of a cheese sandwich)?

Let us revisit the family tree of sandwiches to find the answer. The diagram below shows the taxonomical relationships among different types of sandwiches.

<020>

What is illustrated here is pretty straightforward. "Meat sandwich" is a subset of "sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and "ham sandwich" is a subset of "meat sandwich" because the former is more specific than the latter, and so forth.

<021>

What about "ham & cheese sandwich"? First of all, let me just ask a couple of questions.

Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "ham sandwich"? Oh, yes. Absolutely! It has ham in it, so it is a ham sandwich. Just because it has cheese in it does not make it a non-ham sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "ham sandwich".

Here is another question. Is "ham & cheese sandwich" also a "cheese sandwich"? Yes! It has cheese in it, so it is a cheese sandwich. Just because it has ham in it does not make it a non-cheese sandwich. Therefore, "ham & cheese sandwich" is a subset of "cheese sandwich" as well.

<022>

So, there we have it. The graph can no longer be called a "family tree" (because it is not a tree anymore), and it is no longer purely hierarchical. Nevertheless, we are able to tell that this sort of representation does accurately reflect the nature of mix-and-match among different sandwich types.

<023>

From a set theory point of view, one can say that "ham & cheese sandwich" belongs to the intersection between "ham sandwich" and "cheese sandwich". The reason is that it is both a ham sandwich AND a cheese sandwich at the same time.

Here is a slightly different way of looking at the same subject. A "ham sandwich" only has ham in it, and a "cheese sandwich" only has cheese in it. If you put these two ingredients together inside the same sandwich (by putting them under the same "AND" relation), you will get a "ham & cheese sandwich".

<024>

The pattern we are seeing here curiously resembles the "OR" pattern we saw in the last article. Previously, I have demonstrated that the more choices of ingredient a sandwich has, the more general (i.e. broader) it gets when it comes to categorizing it in a hierarchy.

<025>

The "AND" equivalent of this phenomenon can be depicted in a similar fashion. Here, combining more and more ingredients in one place will put the sandwich into a denser and denser intersection of sandwich types.

<026>

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Sandwich Abstraction Layers</b></h3>

The mix-and-match sort of combination can happen across multiple layers of abstraction as well. For example, nothing prohibits us from stacking "any type of meat" upon a slice of ham, putting this semi-generic pair of ingredients between a pair of bread pieces, and referring to the whole thing as a "ham & meat sandwich".

<027>

This, of course, contains its own expandable bundle of details because the word "meat" suggests a multitude of choices.

<028>

What is interesting is that we are able to compose things that are already results of their own compositions.

Suppose that I decided to put the ingredients of a "ham & cheese sandwich" on top of the ingredients of a "ham & meat sandwich". The resulting product, then, will be called a "ham & meat & ham & cheese sandwich" (or "HMHC sandwich" for short).

<029>

If we graphically depict the hierarchical relationships among the sandwich types introduced so far, we will obtain a diagram which looks like this:

<030>

Notice that the "hierarchy" of sandwiches is no longer a tree; it is more of a generic graph, whose branches not only diverge but also converge.

What you are seeing is an example of the so-called "abstraction layers", where upper layers contain relatively generic sandwiches and lower layers contain relatively specific sandwiches.

<031>

Each layer is connected to its neighboring layers by means of either divergence (i.e. choice of ingredients) or convergence (i.e. composition of ingredients), or both.

As a result, what we are seeing is a vast, intertwined fabric of sandwiches. Some of them are often preferred over others, depending on how harmonious their ingredients are.

For example, it is not hard to expect that a "bacon cheese sandwich" is much more appetizing than, say, a "steamed beans and mashed potato sandwich".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Edges of the Fabric</b></h3>

There are edge cases beyond which the fabric is no longer capable of extending itself, though.

Remember that, in the last article, I mentioned that there are two extreme scenarios called "anything" and "everything", in which the former represents the infinite choice of ingredients, while the latter represents the coexistence of every ingredient?

<012>

These two extreme cases can be thought of as the topmost and bottommost tips of the fabric, respectively.

At the topmost is the so-called "sandwich", which is just a shorthand for "anything sandwich". At the bottommost is the "everything sandwich", which is a sandwich containing the entire universe as its core ingredient.

<032>

The "anything sandwich" is the ancestor of all sandwiches; it is the ultimate birthplace in which literally anything may potentially fill up the space between the two pieces of bread. The "everything sandwich", on the other hand, is the composition of all types of sandwiches we can ever imagine.

@@<h3><b>Evaluation of a Sandwich</b></h3>

How to measure the quality of a sandwich?

It really depends on one's personal taste, but we can still talk about some of the commonly available methodologies. Being able to evaluate the overall quality of a sandwich is a necessary skill to have, in order to become a legendary sandwich craftsman.

<033>

A truly appetizing sandwich must obey the following two principles:

#$
(1) It consists of tasty ingredients.
(2) These ingredients are stacked in a tasty order.
#$

The word "tasty" may sound a bit too subjective, and indeed it is. However, it will appear to be far more sensible if you just interpret it as "generally tasty" or, in other words, "considered tasty by the average eater".

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Taste Scores</b></h3>

Let us begin with the first principle.

The first step toward the making of a highly edible sandwich is to gather ingredients which can be appreciated even when we eat each of them individually. This means that it is crucial for us to first evaluate the quality of each ingredient and assign a number to it (denoting its degree of tastiness). We may refer to this number as the ingredient's "taste score".

<034>

Since a sandwich is a combination of multiple ingredients, a straightforward way of judging its quality is to first evaluate the scores of its individual components and then sum them all up.

Let me start with a simple example. The following image is the anatomy of a cheese sandwich which was showcased before.

<018>

How to calculate its overall score? Oh, it may seem daunting at first, but the problem is not complicated at all as long as you put some thought to it. Let us first assign the appropriate score to each of the sandwich's ingredients, and then take the sum of them (denoted by the "+" sign).

<035>

The result of such computation could be used to represent the overall taste score of the cheese sandwich. Why? Because a cheese sandwich is basically just the "sum" of its three constituents - lower bread, cheese, and upper bread. If we know their individual scores, therefore, it should make sense to assume that the score of the whole sandwich is their sum.

<036>

Assuming that the score of each piece of bread is 7 and the score of each slice of cheese is 10, we may conclude that the score of the cheese sandwich is 7 + 10 + 7 = 24.

<037>

All right, here is the next example. How shall we compute the taste score of a sausage sandwich?

<038>

Here, we will assume that the sausage is an abstract item; that is, the word "sausage" is simply a generic term which is being used to indicate one of the 3 possible choices - chicken sausage, pork sausage, and beef sausage.

<039>

This means that, in order to figure out the taste score of the "sausage" part of the sandwich, we must first know how to determine the score of something uncertain (i.e. something which comes with multiple choices).

This too, however, is not a headache at all. Assuming that each choice has an equal chance of being picked up, we can claim from a statistical point of view that the most expected score of a randomly selected sausage is simply the average score of its 3 potential choices (i.e. chicken, pork, or beef).

<040>

The term "avg" is just a shorthand for "average", by the way. If we suppose that the scores of the 3 aforementioned types of sausages are 13, 14, and 15, respectively, we will be able to conclude that the overall score of the "sausage" in our context is the average of 13, 14, and 15.

<041>

This score calculation procedure can substitute the "sausage" part of the sausage sandwich, yielding the following arithmetic scheme:

<042>

If we compute the "avg" part, we will get this:

<043>

... which eventually simplifies down to a single number, representing the sausage sandwich's overall score (shown below).

<044>

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Pitfalls of Summation</b></h3>

Okay, you might have noticed that there is something fishy in here. It is the fact that, if we are to stick to the above methodology and refuse further elaboration on how scores are to be derived, we will soon be forced to reach the conclusion that a sandwich with more ingredients should score higher than those with fewer ingredients.

This, of course, is not desirable. Unless you are a mere glutton whose only interest is to eat as much as possible, you will agree that packing more ingredients does not necessarily yield a better sandwich.

Let us take a cheese sandwich as an example. We know that it has a single slice of cheese in it, so it makes sense to simply add the score of the cheese to the sandwich's total score.

Since cheese is a highly favored ingredient (because it is tasty), let us add an additional slice of cheese to the sandwich and make it a "double-cheese sandwich".

<045>

If we are to follow the scoring method established so far, we will have to say that adding this additional slice of cheese will basically double the cheese-score of the sandwich. This feels a bit excessive, but, let us move on anyways.

Next, I will try adding yet another slice of cheese to this double-cheese sandwich and turn it into a "triple-cheese sandwich". What will the new score be?

<046>

Of course, it will be even higher than that of the double-cheese sandwich, simply because there are more slices of cheese in this case.

The problem with this approach is that it just keeps incrementing the score as we add more and more ingredients.

What if we put 4 slices of cheese instead of 3? What about 5, 6, 7, or even 100 slices of cheese? Should a hundred-cheese sandwich score about 100 times higher than a single-cheese sandwich? Probably not. No one wants to eat a sandwich with a hundred slices of cheese in it.

Therefore, a mere summation of the individual ingredient scores does not accurately reflect the sandwich's overall score.

@@<hr>
@@<div class="l_spacer"></div>
@@<h3><b>Relational Taste Scores</b></h3>

So, what's the solution? First off, we definitely need a better way to tell how good a sandwich is. Let us revisit the previous cheese sandwich example.

<018>

Just by looking at the ingredients, I am able to tell that it should score pretty high because it has cheese in it, yet not "too" high because it has cheese only and nothing else. A slice of ham would have made it a lot more appetizing.

But the question is, will this sandwich become more appetizing if I add a totally random thing as an extra ingredient, such as apple jam?

<047>

In my opinion, both a "cheese sandwich" and an "apple jam sandwich" deserve high scores, while a sandwich which contains both cheese AND apple jam in it does not.

The reason behind this is that cheese and apple jam usually do not pair up well. Some people might find it particularly attractive, but I do not believe that such appetite is commonplace (Consider "mint chocolate" as an example).

The main problem here is that when two things are combined, their values do not necessarily add up. Depending on how harmonious they are when put together, they may introduce either synergy or dissonance.

Take a look at the following example here, which shows the anatomy of a PB&J (Peanut Butter & Jelly) sandwich.

<048>

Compare this with the "cheese & apple jam sandwich" we saw before. If you are equipped with a decent sense of taste, you should probably agree that the PB&J sandwich deserves a much higher score than the other one. Peanut butter and jelly is a way better choice of combination than the one between cheese and apple jam.

This sort of reasoning leads us to the conclusion that, when evaluating a sandwich, we must take into account not only the scores of the individual ingredients, but also the scores of their relations.

Here is an alternative scoring method.

<049>

As you can tell from the pictures above, I am now assigning scores to pairs of neighboring items, not the items themselves (Notice that the pairing of peanut butter and jelly produces a higher score than that of cheese and apple jam). Then, I am simply taking their average to obtain the overall score of the sandwich.

This, too, has its own flaws. For instance, it does not consider cases in which we are duplicating the same thing a bunch of times (e.g. 100 cheese slices).

Nevertheless, what is shown above is an improvement over the previous methodology, and we are free to keep rectifying it. For now, though, I will pause here and move on to other important topics.
