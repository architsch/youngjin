<h1>Generative AI</h1>
<h2>2022.11</h2>
<p>With the rise of generative AI, we are heading toward a major crisis which we have never encountered before.</p>
<p>First, it will be artists and designers who are going to lose their jobs. Next, it will be social influencers, storytellers, educators, comedians, journalists, and eventually, engineers.</p>
<p>I want to believe, however, that there is still a hope.</p>
<p>In the novel "The Little Prince", the boy says:</p>
<p>"There might be millions of roses in the whole world, but youâ€™re my only one, unique rose."</p>
<p>Generative AI will eventually be able to design and reproduce millions of roses based on utmost degrees of variety and creativity, undermining the imaginative power of even the most ingenious thinkers of all time. However, it still won't be able to get rid of the awareness that every one of us keeps our own precious little rose in our heart.</p>
