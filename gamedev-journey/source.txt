[A Game Developer's Journey - Chapter 1] December 6, 2023

<001>

(Chapter 1 - The Beginning)

Once upon a time, there was a game developer living in his mom's basement.

Although it was years after he graduated from a liberal arts college, he still could not manage to find his first job. As a result, he had no choice but follow his childhood dream - that is, making video games for a living.

From now on, we will simply refer to him as "GameDev", for his name is not important for the story.

Months after months, and years after years, he spent all of his time trying to come up with the best video game in the world as a solo developer. He drew his own concept arts, wrote his own backstories, and coded his own scripts for gameplay.

Yet such a prolonged period of solitude was mostly in vain, and he faced constant disillusionment and sheer frustration. His own talent, as well as his feeble struggle to illuminate it, resulted in hardly anything other than a series of howls in empty, heartless space.

It was one sunny day during which he finally discharged his last remaining vestige of masculine indignation.

"This is meaningless!" Exclaimed GameDev, in the midst of his personal Unity license renewal.

He punched a side of his plastic desk. A pair of pennies, an outdated key, and a Papa John's coupon flung themselves across the air and violently hit the floor. He cried.

"This is utterly meaningless! I woke up in the morning just like any other morning. I have, once again, yet another handful of ideas for another indie game. Then what? What is the meaning of this?"

He stood up and wandered in desperation.

"If I devise yet another game and publish it, what difference will it make? There are millions of games being produced by countless experts all over the world, and mine will probably be overlooked anyways. What is the point of such an endeavor, then?

"There are so many talented folks out there - those extroverted 'influencers' who always socialize with ease, work with teams of passionate minds, and never fail to win the heart of the audience. They fill the world of entertainment with the utmost understanding of what everybody wants to see, hear, and feel. Who am I, then, in this Colosseum of bread and circuses?"

He lied down on the cold concrete floor, and gazed at the ceiling. The whole room as dead silent, which enabled him to hear his own resonance of exhaustion in a painfully clear manner.

"Maybe I have been dreaming in my own fantasy, while the real world was something completely different."

Suddenly, a loud thud broke out and interrupted his existential speculation.

GameDev hurriedly rose up, thinking that somebody sneaked into the basement. He looked around to find a nearby stick, just in case of an unwelcome intruder.

"Be not afraid," said a strange voice out of nowhere.

He turned toward the direction of the sound. To his surprise, he saw an enormous pink square hovering amidst thin air, directly facing him. It was a perfect square with neither texture nor any sign of reflection. It simply emitted pure magenta, which was equally bright in every angle.

"Who are you?" Asked GameDev, suspecting that he was hallucinating.

"I am the light of your mind," replied the square. "I am here to help you become a successful game developer."

The square began to move across the room at a constant speed, while keeping its face directly towards GameDev.

Several seconds later, the square hit the wall, bounced back at the angle of reflection without any apparent loss of momentum, and immediately ceased its motion once it came right in front of GameDev.

"First of all, my pronouns are she/her," murmured the square. "But don't get me wrong, I am genderless. The purpose of this is to let the reader easily distinguish between you and I while following the story."

GameDev nodded and said, "Understood. It is a pretty clever idea. I wonder why the author hasn't won a Nobel Prize in Literature yet."

The square continued her speech. "You are tired of this perpetual cycle of hopelessness, aren't you? I am here to save you from this self-inflicted curse of yours. I know you need some guidance regarding the question of your future vocation, which is quite complicated in nature and cannot be summarized by your inner voice alone."

"I agree," admitted GameDev. At this point, he didn't really care whether he was dreaming or whether the square was just a piece of his own imagination; he was desperate enough to seize any string of hope that was handed over to him, and had no luxury to care about its legitimacy.

"That's why I came over to you, from the deepest and most abused organ of your only friend over there," said the square majestically. A floating finger popped out of nowhere and indicated the gaming PC which was located in the darkest corner of the basement.

While making a bouncy pointing gesture, the finger accidentally touched the headphone which was hanging on the chair. The headphone fell to the ground, so the finger grabbed and placed it back to where it was.

(Chapter 2 - The Way)

"Anyway, you get the idea," said the square. "You are trapped in the middle of nowhere, not knowing what to do to make sense of what you are aiming for. You want to become a competent gamedev, yet do not possess any major resource to make that happen. You are left clueless in your own prison of wishful thinking."

"Yes, you are right," GameDev conceded rather painfully. "What should I do, then?"

"Which things have you been trying?" Asked the square.

GameDev replied. "I tried many things, including concept arts, mechanics, lores, plots, dialogues, and many others. Some of them worked out pretty nicely, but the problem is that I am not the only one who makes such attempts."

"You know it very well," answered the square with a light grin. "You know exactly what the problem is. The game industry is saturated. Even if you come up with the most groundbreaking masterpiece, your work will most likely be forgotten."

"I know."

"And people's attention span is shorter than the shortest ruler required to measure the size of your soul."

"What to do, then?" Inquired GameDev.

"Just give up, if you have enough humility to do so," she replied.

"I cannot," he insisted. "It is not that games are my lifelong passion or something; I am way past that sort of juvenile ego. I am unable to forsake my dream not because I am emotionally attached to it, but because there is nothing else I am particularly good at."

The square flickered a couple of times and resumed her voice. "You clearly understand why you are stuck in Limbo. You have a rather abstract goal to which you would like to dedicate your life, but you are not sure if you are approaching it the right way."

She enlarged herself for a brief moment, and then shrank back in size. "Although you haven't mentioned, I know that you are aware of the horror that is visible everywhere. Every morning, you witness yet another technological 'innovation' which promises to render human endeavor obsolete. Meanwhile, more and more people join the party and the heat of competition never calms down because 'making a game' is becoming easier than ever."

The square paused. GameDev tried to think of something to say, yet he failed to do so because her speech was rather dry and uninspiring. What she just said was pretty much what he already had in his mind.

"But," she resumed, "You ought to behold that, while there are a thousand obstacles hindering your way, there are also a thousand keys to unlock your way out. They are all right before your face; you are just too blind to recognize them."

"What do you mean?" Inquired GameDev.

She explained. "Opportunities are everywhere. There are so many, yet most people do not perceive them because they do not see the other side of what they have been facing. This is why the competition never eases itself, nor does it ever change its trajectory; most of its participants only know how to solve a problem in one way, without ever thinking of the possibility that other solutions might exist."

"I know that there are so-called 'hidden opportunities'," said GameDev, "which I take with a grain of salt because most of them are just trendy buzzwords pitched by marketing experts."

"Exactly," said the square with a chuckle. "That is why most people grab false clues and constantly get lured into thinking that they are pioneers of something revolutionary, while all they are doing is simply worship the latest fad and follow it like a herd of clueless sheep."

She continued. "I am speaking of real opportunities, not the phony ones you just mentioned."

"Every salesman talks like that," he responded with a rather explicit form of contempt.

"Unless you are conversing with someone trustworthy, for sure," the square reproached. "I am here not for the purpose of selling anything, but to show you the way."

"What is the 'way' you are talking about?" He inquired suspiciously.

"The way," she answered.

GameDev thought for a couple of seconds and asked, "You mean, the way to become a successful game developer?"

"It's a rhetorical question, isn't it?" She replied. "You know that the 'way' you are searching for is indeed supposed to fulfill your current desire. While there may be multiple ways, we will still be able to treat them as one as long as they all guide you to the same destination."

"How can you tell for sure," interrupted GameDev with a doubt, "that you are able to show me a way which is guaranteed to work? I have made numerous attempts to find one, yet they all turned out to be in vain."

The square moved closer to GameDev and gently whispered. "In order to discover a solution, you must dig deep into the heart of the problem and divine its true nature. And to do that, you must experience every aspect of what makes up a game."

Before GameDev had time to respond, she ascended by a few inches and made a brief humming noise. In a second, the whole basement disappeared and they were both surrounded by a mysterious panorama of colorful lights.

(Chapter 3 - The Amusement Park)

GameDev looked around in surprise, and found out that he was standing in the middle of a small plaza.

"Where are we?" He asked.

"We are in the Amusement Park, the place where only fun and smiles are allowed," answered the square.

He observed his surroundings and saw a carousel, a clown handing over lollipops to children, and a myriad of colorful cabins embellished with cartoon characters and scintillating rainbow orbs. Over the roofs, colossal roller coasters were pouring gushes of joyous scream into the void.

The square shouted with pride. "Don't look so distressed like that. This is the place of pure happiness. You must have fun, and fun only, with a big smile on your face."

GameDev looked away in sheer confusion. On his left, he saw a horde of bumper cars jostling like nervous mice. Their passengers were throwing bouncy beach balls at each other, laughing frantically.

"What is the meaning of this?" He asked.

"You are literally seeing games - lots of games," answered the square proudly. "Look at the Ferris wheel over there, the pirate ship over here, and the spooky ghost house right behind you! Every ride you see here is a game you can enjoy."

"Games are supposed to be interactive," insisted GameDev.

"Are they?" she responded with a grin. "Or is it merely an illusion of interactivity you are talking about? People play games not to interact, but to see what they want to see."

GameDev disagreed. "A game still needs to involve interactions in order to let people choose what they want."

Upon hearing this, the square mused for a bit. There was a round of fireworks going on over the Amusement Park's iconic castle. Once their thunderous claps were dispersed, she spoke up again.

"A decent game gives the audience free will. A competent game gives the audience what they want for free. Remember that convenience trumps hard-earned happiness; one's freedom of choice is nothing more than a moral fantasy as long as one is not willing to choose."

"What do you mean?" GameDev asked.

She moved forward and continued to speak. "Being able to make decisions is indeed an alleged virtue of those who feign their intellect. Yet when it comes to choosing between an easy treat and a hard treat, the vast majority will pick the easy one. And the best game is one which promises to feed you spoonfuls of sugar without forcing you to think."

"It won't work in the long run," said GameDev. "People are smart enough to discern such a condescending type of psychological exploitation."

"Oh, you have no idea," exclaimed the square. "In the world flooded with countless games, only a few which fulfill the player's gluttony in the most embarrassingly blatant manner will win the race."

She moved aside to let him watch his surroundings once again. There were various rides all over the Amusement Park, all busily undertaking their soulless mechanical movements to entertain their visitors. Their perpetual clockwork ceaselessly inhaled and exhaled waves of people. This left GameDev dumbfounded.

"Every one of these rides is a game chosen by the crowd," said the square melancholically. "It does not matter whether these rides are simply repeating the same old ritual; people chose to ride them anyways, and your definition of what a game is supposed to be has no voice here."

GameDev tried to say something cynical in response to her speech. While he was about to do so, however, he saw a child tapping a gigantic red button to crack open a piñata which was placed right before an automatic slapstick. He became pensive.

After a minute or so, a sudden flash of wit crossed his mind. "Although focusing on the player's utmost desire is indeed an effective means of selling the game," he suggested, "such a method quickly gets old. Besides, since so many games are taking such a route, coming up with yet another silly ride is hardly going to make any profit unless it is aided by an enormous marketing budget."

"The majority's voice is always right," mumbled the square, "when it comes to popularity. You may fancy that novelty is a hidden path to success, but from a statistical point of view, nothing beats mediocrity. The average is the average for a reason."

"But competing will be too hard unless I try something different," he protested.

She responded grimly. "The size of your potential audience will surmount the weight of such a drawback. You may invent something revolutionary and write a whole new page of history out of its legacy, but the fate of a rebel is lifelong ridicule. It all boils down to the matter of chance. You are very likely to fail if you do not follow the norm."

GameDev interrupted. "Is this the only advice you can give to me?"

"No," answered the square. "I am not done yet. These 'games' you have seen so far indeed reveal part of the truth, yet they do not represent the entirety of it. I will show you that there are more things going on behind the stage."

She moved away a bit and made another humming noise.
