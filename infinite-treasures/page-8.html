<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br>OFFICIAL SCRIPT OF THE BEST-SELLING VIDEOGAME: "The Island of Infinite Treasures"<br>CHAPTER 8: An Intellectual Challenge<br>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(Player and the girl spend the next few minutes following the dungeon's cavernous corridor.)</p>
<p>(Soon the corridor comes to an end. They find themselves entering a much broader cavern, in the middle of which is a table that has a circular hole on its top as well as a cylinder next to it whose cross section has the exact same size as the hole.)</p>
<p>Girl: "This is an extremely sophisticated puzzle that can only be solved by the smartest person in the world."</p>
<p>(The screen fades out and begins to display portraits of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and other famous historical figures. After quoting some of their most famous words in a deep masculine voice, the screen resumes back to the sight of the table.)</p>
<p>Girl: (Looking at the table), "One must solve this puzzle in order to unlock treasures that are hidden from us." (Kneeling down and starting to cry), "I am so sorry because I understand that you do not want to use your brain at any occasion because you are a gamer."</p>
<p>(A payment window appears on the screen. Its background is decorated with images of young women in swimming suits.)</p>
<p>Girl: (Sobbing), "Visa and Mastercard are also available options."</p>
<p>(Player clicks the payment button. After a brief moment, the cylinder slides itself through the table's circular hole. Fireworks and clapping sounds promptly burst out, letting the player know that he just solved the puzzle.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms out and reveals the entire floor, which is now filled with glowing chests and rainbow-colored crystals.)</p>
