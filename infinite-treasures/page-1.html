<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br>OFFICIAL SCRIPT OF THE BEST-SELLING VIDEOGAME: "The Island of Infinite Treasures"<br>CHAPTER 1: Introduction<br>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(Intro music begins. A genderless gray humanoid suddenly appears in front of the player.)</p>
<p>Gray Humanoid: "Are you male or female?"</p>
<p>Player: "Male."</p>
<p>(The humanoid turns into a stunningly beautiful girl with blond hair.)</p>
<p>Girl: "Welcome to The Island of Infinite Treasures. As an NPC whose only purpose in life is to serve you as a loyal servant, I am thrilled to announce that you are the only hero in this universe who can save every one of us from acting out the most tragic-looking cinematic cutscene you will ever be able to watch in this game."</p>
<p>(Wind blows dramatically.)</p>
<p>Girl: "Since you are a gamer who was brave enough to squander a significant amount of money for a mere piece of entertainment, I am sure that you are not a fan of long intellectual conversations. So please let me skip all the subtle narratives and jump right into the most immediately fascinating part."</p>
<p>(Flashback begins. The girl frantically shakes her head in order to demonstrate the game's realistic hair physics.)</p>
<p>Girl: "Once upon a time..."</p>
<p>(A caption appears at the bottom of the screen. The girl hurriedly snatches it and dumps every one of its alphabets in a nearby recycling bin.)</p>
<p>Girl: "Oh, I'm sorry. I know you hate reading because you are a gamer. Please let me continue."</p>
<p>(The girl frantically shakes her head again, this time with a sparkling visual effect. The screen fades out and starts to display a dark mountain.)</p>
