<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br>OFFICIAL SCRIPT OF THE BEST-SELLING VIDEOGAME: "The Island of Infinite Treasures"<br>CHAPTER 9: Rewards<br>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(Camera slowly zooms back and navigates around the floor, closely examining fanfare animations of every one of the shiny treasures. An oversaturated pink chest starts to dance in front of the camera, while others are waiting in a queue preparing their own dance moves.)</p>
<p>Girl: (With a look of passionate delight), "Oh, you are the smartest man I have ever witnessed throughout my whole life!"</p>
<p>(The girl grabs her iPhone and starts texting.)</p>
<p>Girl: "I will invite my female friends to come and worship your supreme intelligence. You are the first person in history who figured out how to make a circular shape pass through a circular hole."</p>
<p>(The screen fades out of the upcoming scenery of random girls rushing toward the player, and begins to play a cinematic 3D animation of the cylinder passing through the table's circular hole. The video replays itself several times in slow motion, so as to ensure that the player did watch and understand it.)</p>
<p>(The video suddenly stops. A huge puff of smoke, created by a sudden explosion, briefly fills up the whole cavern. After several seconds, the smoke vanishes and reveals an old man who is wearing starry pajamas and long white beard. The ID card on his chest suggests that his name is: "Wise Old Man".)</p>
<p>Wise Old Man: (Pushing girls aside), "Everyone deserves love and peace. Stay safe, and don't let anything bad happen to you! Everyone's opinion is equally important, and we must save our planet!"</p>
<p>(He then disappears with a puff of smoke.)</p>
<p>Girl: (Facing the player), "He is a retired wizard who appears in random places and gives words of wisdom to everyone."</p>
