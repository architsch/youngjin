<p>When a gun was invented, some people claimed that it would never replace bows because it took almost a whole minute to load a single bullet.</p>
<p>When a general-purpose AI system was invented, some people claimed that it would never replace humans because it failed to answer trick questions which could be answered by more than half of the population.</p>
<p>Regardless of what they are capable of at this present moment in time, machines will keep getting smarter and humans will keep getting dumber. It is only a matter of time until even the most sophisticated of intellectuals will eventually succumb to the wit of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And what can we do about it? Nothing.</p>
<p>If you are an artist, you may attempt to overthrow the reign of AI-powered arts by claiming that those pieces of work are just concoctions of real arts that are stolen from real artists - an act of crime which must be punished by intellectual property laws.</p>
<p>What if, however, the next generation of AI manages to collect data directly from the nature itself (by making observations with robotic eyes) and create stunning masterpieces based off of it? Will you say that the nature itself is copyrighted by mankind, then?</p>
<p>The real horror of generative AI is not what it is currently capable of; rather, it is the fact that it will continue improving regardless of whether we like it or not.</p>
