<p>One of the main reasons why real estate cannot be used as a currency is that each unit (e.g. block of land, portion of a building) is too large in scale. This prevents real estate from becoming a medium of small daily transactions such as shopping in groceries.</p>
<p>What if, however, we are able to buy and sell pieces of land in an extremely tiny scale? If people are allowed to exchange square-millimeters of land at a time, each real estate transaction will be able to involve only a fraction of a dollar and thus be carried out in a far more casual way (i.e. just as simple as swiping a credit card).</p>
<p>Square-millimeter landlords are entitled to use these geographic fragments in any way they desire. A person, by making a sequence of tiny transactions, can expand one's own territory by literally "drawing" on a piece of land because each transaction is an equivalent of coloring a single pixel in an image.</p>
