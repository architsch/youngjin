What is "real"? And what is "not real"?

When it comes to the matter of defining reality, we often stumble upon the notion that it is not so easy to establish a persistent set of criteria through which any unit of existence in our faculty of reasoning can be identified as either real or unreal.

When somebody asks, "Is X real?", one cannot rightfully reject the inner conviction that the answer to such a question heavily depends on the context to which it belongs.

First of all, what is "X"? We must know what X is in order to be able to tell whether it is real or not.

Secondly, what does "real" even mean? If we suppose that X is a tangible object, will the word "real" imply that a class of objects called "X" can be defined, just as a pink unicorn is capable of being fully described aside from whether or not it is physically present in our material universe?

Or, will it imply that at least one instance of such a class of objects is capable of being observed? And if it can be observed, what mode of observation should be deemed convincing enough to qualify itself as a proof of existence of such an instance? For example, does a pink unicorn which I saw during my last night's dream possess the right to claim itself as an existential evidence of a pink unicorn?

Due to the possibility of such speculations, defining reality and its constituents from a holistic perspective quickly becomes an inexplicably convoluted task whenever we try to reason through it. And this oftentimes urges us to regard the concept of reality as one which appertains to a specific context in which every piece of information is clearly defined.

When somebody asks: "Is 1+1=2 real?", the one who hears such a question typically responds by saying "yes" not because the question alone explains everything, but because both the questioner and the answerer are implicitly agreeing with each other that they are conversing within the context of standard algebra. The answer would've been different if the questioner mentioned beforehand that one is talking about boolean algebra.

When somebody asks: "Is algebra real?", on the other hand, one can be expected to respond with a counter-question such as: "What do you mean by 'real'?". The reason for such an inquiry is that the concept of algebra does not belong to any of the answerer's presumed contexts of reasoning in which it can be classified as either real or unreal. Mathematics defines its own scope of reality in its own context, but it does not necessarily mean that mathematics itself is defined as "real" within a wider context.

Therefore, an easy conclusion which can be drawn from the above observations is that our so-called "reality" is nothing more than a superfluous attribute that is attached to specific domains of reasoning, each of which is "artificial" in the sense that it is formulated out of a set of arbitrary symbols and their relations.

Yet, here is another question which naturally arises out of the mind of pretty much any metaphysical thinker. Is there any entity that is always "real" regardless of the context in which it is being conceived? In other words, does it make any sense to assert that there is a concept which can be defined as a constituent of "absolute reality", which encompasses the whole of our boundary of reasoning?

In order to answer such a fundamental inquiry, one must endeavor to identify the ultimate origin of reason itself, for reason is the source of our definition of what is real and what is unreal. One may disagree with this presupposition and say that not everything can be explained rationally and therefore reason-based thought process alone cannot possibly capture the full picture of what reality is, but I would argue that I am talking about "defining" reality here instead of trying to tell what it is based upon a mere assortment of unstructured impressions.

Such preference is justified under the premise that the words I am writing here are meant to be a discourse and not a dry narration of somebody's daydream. Their purpose is to prove something, and to prove something is to draw conclusions from a set of clearly defined pieces of logic. If somebody is so "creative" as to suggest that not everything can be explained in terms of "boring math equations", I will say that such a line of argument is completely off-topic here.

If we assume for now that the idea of reality itself has its context-free origin, it will be imperative that at least a segment of our faculty of reasoning ought not to be completely free from the necessity to classify units of definition into two disjoint categories: "real" and "unreal". The main reason behind this statement is that, if such a dichotomy is independent from any specific context, it must reside directly under the superset of all conceivable contexts.

Will it ever be feasible, then, to come up with a source of definition which does not depend upon any preceding set of definitions (nor contexts which contain them), yet still manages to yield a predicate which can either be evaluated as "real" or "unreal"?

In order to discover such an underlying fountain of truth, one must unlearn mankind's already established set of worldly prejudices and only retain the bare minimum set of ideas from which one is able to conduct an activity which could be referred to as "reasoning".

[The Origin of Reality - Volume 2] October 13, 2023

(Continued from volume 1)

Searching for the essence of reality is not an easy task, yet there are morsels of intuition which suggest us that its birthplace may be closer to one's soul than anything else. The hard part is to identify this heart of meaning and present it in a way which can be formulated in a language which we can comprehend on a rational basis.

Firstly, let us ask ourselves: "What are the building blocks of reality?" In other words, what are the conceptual ingredients which comprise the set of all possible definitions that can be classified as either "real" or "unreal" outside of any particular context?

There are myriads of theories in academia which proudly give their own answers to this kind of inquiry. Some of them claim that material phenomena (such as laws of mechanics) are the essence of the universe, and that mental activities as well as their ensuing qualia are mere byproducts which emerged out of physical interactions. Others, on the other hand, claim that everything originates from psychological phenomena because even the most materialistic entities (e.g. a solid object) reveal their existence only when they are being perceived by a conscious agent.

There are other groups, too, who rather prefer to avoid taking sides. Some say that both the mind and body possess their own shares of existence, implying that there is some kind of parallelism between what is happening in the psychological realm and what is happening in the physical realm. Others tend to suggest that these two aspects of reality are nothing but two sides of the same coin, which may be characterized by the word "monism".

But before plunging into a typical rigmarole of sophist wordplay, let us retain our sense of decency which encourages us to reason in terms of concepts in their purest form, rather than trying to build layers upon layers of groundless abstraction designed to gratify pseudo-intellectuals whose ego demands its throne in the midst of a jungle of meaningless technicality.

I will first describe to you the limit of my faculty of reasoning, for it is crucial for one to clearly state the boundary of one's intellectual capacity in order to be able to assert the validity of at least a subset of one's worldview. Clearly acknowledged ignorance speaks more truth than all-knowing stupidity.

At the core, my thoughts are the only ingredients from which I am able to formulate my arguments. Without thoughts and their ensuing process of thinking, I can neither define nor prove anything. And if I cannot prove anything, the purpose of this writing will vanish into nothingness. Thus, I have no choice but simply begin my line of metaphysical reasoning from the assumption that my own thoughts are some kind of self-proclaimed existential entities, since it is pretty much as far as my definition of existence can go. This is my limit, and any statement I happen to prove under such a constraint must be bounded by such a limit.

It may be claimed that there is something called "external reality" whose intricacies dwell outside of my domain of thoughts, yet it is pointless to ponder upon it as long as there is no way for me to conceptualize it.

Some people may say that I must be quite narrow-minded if I assert that my thoughts are the only sources of what one could refer to as "reality", since there are also intuitively understood phenomena (such as consciousness) which are antecedent to thoughts themselves.

To this facet of reason, I would say that an isolated bubble of intuition should stay within the realm of intuition only, and not dare to trespass the fortified wall of logic.

On a personal level, for sure, I do feel that I am a conscious being, detached from the rest of the world by means of this mysterious sense of self-awareness of mine which can never be observed anywhere else but within my very self. And some people use this unique angle of impression to back up their claim that there is this thing called "consciousness" which partitions the universe into two distinct types of beings - those which exist inside of one's consciousness, and those which exist outside of it.

Will this dichotomy even make sense, however, if we admit that consciousness itself is not a clearly defined idea in the first place?

I feel that I possess consciousness, yet this is just a feeling. I cannot prove its existence, nor can I tell what it is at all, which means that consciousness is not something which can be defined. All I can say is that I just "feel" it, and as far as my reasoning goes, there is no method through which I can expand my domain of thoughts beyond this crude expression. And since consciousness is undefined, it will be logically fallacious for me to say that "consciousness exists". A statement whose procedure of evaluation depends on an undefined parameter must be expected to be undefined, unless there is a peculiar reason to presuppose that the idea of "undefinedness" itself, when applied to such a statement, provides a way to yield a definable result.
