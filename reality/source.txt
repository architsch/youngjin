[The Origin of Reality - Volume 1] October 12, 2023

What is "real"? And what is "not real"?

When it comes to the matter of defining reality, we often stumble upon the notion that it is not so easy to establish a persistent set of criteria through which any unit of existence in our faculty of reasoning can be identified as either real or unreal.

When somebody asks, "Is X real?", one cannot rightfully reject the inner conviction that the answer to such a question heavily depends on the context to which it belongs.

First of all, what is "X"? We must know what X is in order to be able to tell whether it is real or not.

Secondly, what does "real" even mean? If we suppose that X is a tangible object, will the word "real" imply that a class of objects called "X" can be defined, just as a pink unicorn is capable of being fully described aside from whether or not it is physically present in our material universe?

Or, will it imply that at least one instance of such a class of objects is capable of being observed? And if it can be observed, what mode of observation should be deemed convincing enough to qualify itself as a proof of existence of such an instance? For example, does a pink unicorn which I saw during my last night's dream possess the right to claim itself as an existential evidence of a pink unicorn?

Due to the possibility of such speculations, defining reality and its constituents from a holistic perspective quickly becomes an inexplicably convoluted task whenever we try to reason through it. And this oftentimes urges us to regard the concept of reality as one which appertains to a specific context in which every piece of information is clearly defined.

When somebody asks: "Is 1+1=2 real?", the one who hears such a question typically responds by saying "yes" not because the question alone explains everything, but because both the questioner and the answerer are implicitly agreeing with each other that they are conversing within the context of standard algebra. The answer would've been different if the questioner mentioned beforehand that one is talking about boolean algebra.

When somebody asks: "Is algebra real?", on the other hand, one can be expected to respond with a counter-question such as: "What do you mean by 'real'?". The reason for such an inquiry is that the concept of algebra does not belong to any of the answerer's presumed contexts of reasoning in which it can be classified as either real or unreal. Mathematics defines its own scope of reality in its own context, but it does not necessarily mean that mathematics itself is defined as "real" within a wider context.

Therefore, an easy conclusion which can be drawn from the above observations is that our so-called "reality" is nothing more than a superfluous attribute that is attached to specific domains of reasoning, each of which is "artificial" in the sense that it is formulated out of a set of arbitrary symbols and their relations.

Yet, here is another question which naturally arises out of the mind of pretty much any metaphysical thinker. Is there any entity that is always "real" regardless of the context in which it is being conceived? In other words, does it make any sense to assert that there is a concept which can be defined as a constituent of "absolute reality", which encompasses the whole of our boundary of reasoning?

In order to answer such a fundamental inquiry, one must endeavor to identify the ultimate origin of reason itself, for reason is the source of our definition of what is real and what is unreal. One may disagree with this presupposition and say that not everything can be explained rationally and therefore reason-based thought process alone cannot possibly capture the full picture of what reality is, but I would argue that I am talking about "defining" reality here instead of trying to tell what it is based upon a mere assortment of unstructured impressions.

Such preference is justified under the premise that the words I am writing here are meant to be a discourse and not a dry narration of somebody's daydream. Their purpose is to prove something, and to prove something is to draw conclusions from a set of clearly defined pieces of logic. If somebody is so "creative" as to suggest that not everything can be explained in terms of "boring math equations", I will say that such a line of argument is completely off-topic here.

If we assume for now that the idea of reality itself has its context-free origin, it will be imperative that at least a segment of our faculty of reasoning ought not to be completely free from the necessity to classify units of definition into two disjoint categories: "real" and "unreal". The main reason behind this statement is that, if such a dichotomy is independent from any specific context, it must reside directly under the superset of all conceivable contexts.

Will it ever be feasible, then, to come up with a source of definition which does not depend upon any preceding set of definitions (nor contexts which contain them), yet still manages to yield a predicate which can either be evaluated as "real" or "unreal"?

In order to discover such an underlying fountain of truth, one must unlearn mankind's already established set of worldly prejudices and only retain the bare minimum set of ideas from which one is able to conduct an activity which could be referred to as "reasoning".

[The Origin of Reality - Volume 2] October 13, 2023

(Continued from volume 1)

Searching for the essence of reality is not an easy task, yet there are morsels of intuition which suggest us that its birthplace may be closer to one's soul than anything else. The hard part is to identify this heart of meaning and present it in a way which can be formulated in a language which we can comprehend on a rational basis.

Firstly, let us ask ourselves: "What are the building blocks of reality?" In other words, what are the conceptual ingredients which comprise the set of all possible definitions that can be classified as either "real" or "unreal" outside of any particular context?

There are myriads of theories in academia which proudly give their own answers to this kind of inquiry. Some of them claim that material phenomena (such as laws of mechanics) are the essence of the universe, and that mental activities as well as their ensuing qualia are mere byproducts which emerged out of physical interactions. Others, on the other hand, claim that everything originates from psychological phenomena because even the most materialistic entities (e.g. a solid object) reveal their existence only when they are being perceived by a conscious agent.

There are other groups, too, who rather prefer to avoid taking sides. Some say that both the mind and body possess their own shares of existence, implying that there is some kind of parallelism between what is happening in the psychological realm and what is happening in the physical realm. Others tend to suggest that these two aspects of reality are nothing but two sides of the same coin, which may be characterized by the word "monism".

But before plunging into a typical rigmarole of sophist wordplay, let us retain our sense of decency which encourages us to reason in terms of concepts in their purest form, rather than trying to build layers upon layers of groundless abstraction designed to gratify pseudo-intellectuals whose ego demands its throne in the midst of a jungle of meaningless technicality.

I will first describe to you the limit of my faculty of reasoning, for it is crucial for one to clearly state the boundary of one's intellectual capacity in order to be able to assert the validity of at least a subset of one's worldview. Clearly acknowledged ignorance speaks more truth than all-knowing stupidity.

At the core, my thoughts are the only ingredients from which I am able to formulate my arguments. Without thoughts and their ensuing process of thinking, I can neither define nor prove anything. And if I cannot prove anything, the purpose of this writing will vanish into nothingness. Thus, I have no choice but simply begin my line of metaphysical reasoning from the assumption that my own thoughts are some kind of self-proclaimed existential entities, since it is pretty much as far as my definition of existence can go. This is my limit, and any statement I happen to prove under such a constraint must be bounded by such a limit.

It may be claimed that there is something called "external reality" whose intricacies dwell outside of my domain of thoughts, yet it is pointless to ponder upon it as long as there is no way for me to conceptualize it.

Some people may say that I must be quite narrow-minded if I assert that my thoughts are the only sources of what one could refer to as "reality", since there are also intuitively understood phenomena (such as consciousness) which are antecedent to thoughts themselves.

To this facet of reason, I would say that an isolated bubble of intuition should stay within the realm of intuition only, and not dare to trespass the fortified wall of logic.

On a personal level, for sure, I do feel that I am a conscious being, detached from the rest of the world by means of this mysterious sense of self-awareness of mine which can never be observed anywhere else but within my very self. And some people use this unique angle of impression to back up their claim that there is this thing called "consciousness" which partitions the universe into two distinct types of beings - those which exist inside of one's consciousness, and those which exist outside of it.

Will this dichotomy even make sense, however, if we admit that consciousness itself is not a clearly defined idea in the first place?

I feel that I possess consciousness, yet this is just a feeling. I cannot prove its existence, nor can I tell what it is at all, which means that consciousness is not something which can be defined. All I can say is that I just "feel" it, and as far as my reasoning goes, there is no method through which I can expand my domain of thoughts beyond this crude expression. And since consciousness is undefined, it will be logically fallacious for me to say that "consciousness exists". A statement whose procedure of evaluation depends on an undefined parameter must be expected to be undefined, unless there is a peculiar reason to presuppose that the idea of "undefinedness" itself, when applied to such a statement, provides a way to yield a definable result.

[The Origin of Reality - Volume 3] October 16, 2023

(Continued from volume 2)

In order to discover the ultimate origin of reality, one must avoid taking made-up concepts for granted and attempting to produce logical arguments with them as though they are fundamental constituents of reason.

In the previous volume, I have mentioned that my very own thoughts are the only ingredients from which my definition of reality can possibly originate, based upon the premise that the act of reasoning itself can solely be defined as a set of mysterious beings called "thoughts" and their mutual relations.

One may definitely question this viewpoint by saying that the concept of thoughts, too, must be considered arbitrary, and that it is thus quite inadequate to assume that it should form the basis of one's reasoning. And yes, I do admit that the so-called "thoughts" themselves are mere crumbs of intuition which just popped out of nowhere and thus are undefinable in the sense that there is no concept which is antecedent to them.

Another line of reasoning, however, evinces me that the nature of definitions and their collective system of logic do not necessarily require that every definition be preceded by another definition. That is, I do not perceive any particular reason to suppose that the scope of reality must exclude every definition which simply declares the presence of an arbitrary symbol.

Yet, it is also equally important for us to realize that we should not keep inventing truckloads of symbols for the sake of divining the essence of reality, since there is no particular reason to claim that reality can be understood by means of mere plurality of symbols, either.

The subsequent conclusion one is able to reach based off of the above speculations, then, is that the definition of reality as a whole must begin somewhere which may be characterized as arbitrary, yet such a groundless spot of reason must be kept as minimal as possible in order for us to avoid attaching superfluous ornaments on top of its surface.

From my point of view, I would say that my own thoughts, regardless of what they are, constitute such a groundless spot. The main reason behind this is that I cannot define my thoughts in terms of other definitions, which subsequently obliges me to base my reason upon the arbitrary concept called "thoughts" by assuming that it is the ultimate origin of all definitions other than the one which says: "Let there be thoughts".

Still, there may be objections which question the validity of such a conceptual choice. I will list some of the probable ones and try to refute them below.

(Question 1) "How can you so proudly say that nothing precedes your thoughts? Can't we suppose that there could be an external cause, such as your biological brain from which your mental processes originate, which comes before the occurrence of your thoughts?"

(Answer) What does it mean when someone says that something comes "before" or "after" another? Such a relation makes sense only when we presume some kind of order between at least two discrete entities. And this concept called "order" does not intrinsically show us that it is something so unique, that it cannot be made out of thoughts.

(Question 2) "Since you are a thinking agent and there is no evidence that nothing can possibly exist outside of your domain of thoughts, don't you see that there could be external observers (e.g. other people) who possess their own versions of reality which are made up of their own thought processes?"

(Answer) What does "outside" (or "inside") even mean, if all I can conceive are my own thoughts and absolutely nothing else? Unless I decide to split my area of thoughts into arbitrary subareas, there is no such thing as a boundary. And if there is no boundary, the concept of "outside" ("inside") will have no substance. And there is no such thing as an "external observer" either, since an object that is deemed as such is just part of my observation when it comes to pure sense data. I am the only observer in my definition of observation (unless the definition broadens itself out so that any object which functions as an information relay, such as a video recorder, claims its right to be referred to as an observer), which means that there is no reason to attach a special label called "observer" to myself for the purpose of distinguishing myself from "other observers".

(Question 3) "Why are you telling me so confidently that a set of logical definitions are necessary ingredients of reality? Where is your evidence that logic is required for the purpose of illustrating its nature? Can't it be just as equally valid to suggest that an illogical concoction of ideas could serve as an even more accurate representation of what reality is?"

(Answer) To be fair, an illogical juxtaposition of thoughts can be considered part of the initial condition of logic because a fully independent statement does not have to be bounded by a logical constraint (because there would be nothing antecedent to begin with). However, the course of deriving the definition of reality itself cannot be carried out by an illogical process, since it requires logic to derive a definition from an antecedent definition. If we exclude logic from our faculty of reasoning, any groundless supposition which popped out of nowhere will obtain a right to equate itself with reality (in which case any search for truth loses its volition).

[The Origin of Reality - Volume 4] October 18, 2023

(Continued from volume 3)

In the last volume, I suggested the utilization of what are supposedly the most fundamental (indivisible) constituents of reality, which I referred to as "thoughts".

But for the sake of detaching them from the widely accepted yet subjective understanding of what "thoughts" are (e.g. brain activities, etc), I will henceforth start denoting these hypothetical entities by the term "ideas" instead.

It has been assumed that ideas, as long as one's faculty of reasoning declares that no process of logic can possibly involve a parameter which is unable to be broken down to a composition of ideas, must be considered "real" regardless of their inner or outer characteristics. It is because we are trying to come up with a definition of reality here, and such a definition must be derived logically from preceding ones which ultimately trace back to mere declaration of ideas.

Therefore, we will begin by coming up with a sound method of denoting the availability of ideas and a way in which they can be synthesized with one another for the purpose of revealing more variety of patterns. The first axiom to kickstart the whole line of argument is:

"Any arbitrary expression is an idea."

This means that, no matter which expression we choose to speak in our language, it automatically counts as an idea (because in order to express something, the speaker must think about it). Another axiom which must hold in order to assert the validity of its being is:

"Any idea is a fact."

In our worldview, any idea is a "fact" regardless of the context to which it belongs. It is not an intermediary bridge aimed to serve a purpose, nor does it oblige itself to mean anything; it just "is".

Now here is another primitive building block that is needed to let us formulate patterns out of individual ideas - "association". Ideas themselves are nothing more than instances of nil floating in the midst of nowhere; it is only when they associate themselves with one another that they begin to introduce more syntax than a set of isolated points. We henceforth assume here that there must be not just one, but two primitive data types in the grammar of reality - ideas and their associations.

<001>

In the context of mathematics, one can quite reasonably imagine that the domain of knowledge which is being represented here resembles that of graph theory, in the sense that each idea is an equivalent of a vertex and each association is an equivalent of an edge connecting a pair of vertices.

<002>

And this apparent resemblance may prompt some of those enthusiastic mathematicians in academia to insist that the model of reality I am proposing in this writing is nothing more than a mere reiteration of what has already been researched in the field of mathematics as well as other academic disciplines which depend on the language of graphs.

But before being so quick to ejaculate such a preemptive judgement for the purpose of not letting me hurt the feeling of an army of professional student loan consumers, one's got to behold that analyzing the properties of a graph is not the goal we are aiming for; it is just a convenient tool for demonstrating one's route of reason, just as a finger can be utilized to indicate the Moon without having to be the Moon itself.

Another potential objection which may come to surface is that, since I am initiating a whole stream of thoughts based upon a graph-based language, pretty much every one of its ensuing logical conclusions will still be confined to the boundary of graph theory. This may certainly be a valid point to some extent, yet I would argue that if such a side of reasoning is universally applicable without a single exception, it must also be okay to claim that the theory of finite state machines reveals no more knowledge than what a random graph can disclose due to the fact that such machines can be depicted in terms of state diagrams (i.e. directed graphs).

Here is yet another question which might be raised. And that is: "Why graphs in particular?". Why not use sets, algebraic formulas, logical operators, vectors, matrices, geometric figures, computer algorithms, and myriads of other ways of outlining quantitative concepts?

The reason for choosing the language of graphs is that it is probably the most comprehensive medium of illustration when it comes to pure concepts, including those in mathematics.

<003>

A function is just a bunch of input values being mapped to their respective output values, so it is something we can represent as a bipartite graph in which each edge denotes a mapping relation. A set is just a bunch of parent-child relations between itself and its children (i.e. elements), which can be depicted by a graph. A sequence? It is a graph made up of a chain of elements. A matrix? It is just a group of elements arranged in a mesh-like graph. A tree? It is just a graph without a loop. An algebraic expression? It is basically an expression tree, so it is a graph, too. A geometric shape? It is a graph consisting of a bunch of spatial points (vertices) and line segments (edges). A logical statement? It is just a pile of symbols and their relations, which can all be expressed in terms of vertices and edges. The list goes on.
