@@<h3><b>Mechanical Narratives</b></h3>

A game is usually a combination of two factors - mechanics and narratives.

Mechanics represent the systematic aspects of the game, such as physics, AI, crafting rules, progression curves, and others which rely on the knowledge of math/engineering.

Narratives represent the volitional aspects of the game, such as lores, stories, personalities, goals, and others which rely on the knowledge of arts/humanities.

A problem we often experience is that it is too tricky to fit these two together in one place. Many ambiguous cases are prone to arise, such as:

(1) Having a cool story (narrative) for a video game, but not knowing how to turn it into gameplay (mechanic).
(2) Knowing how to implement a clever enemy AI (mechanic), but not knowing how to design an appropriate enemy character for it (narrative).
(3) Having an interesting NPC with a unique personality (narrative), but not knowing which in-game role it ought to play (mechanic).

A solution is to start designing the game with building blocks which can both be considered mechanics and narratives at the same time (aka "mechanical narratives").

If we start by laying out the game's narratives first, it will be difficult to devise mechanics which are compatible with the given narratives. If we start by laying out the game's mechanics first, on the other hand, it will be difficult to devise narratives which are compatible with the given mechanics.

Such a dilemma can be bypassed by simply collecting a number of "mechanical narratives" and assembling them together.

@@<h3><b>Sensors, Filters, and Motors</b></h3>

In general, a gameplay agent can be constructed by assembling 3 types of modules - sensors, filters, and motors.

Sensors collect data from the environment, filters process the data (for analysis), and motors trigger the agent to take actions based upon the filtered data.

Here is an example. Imagine that there is an anti-aircraft gun whose role is to shoot down enemy airplanes in range. We can model this gun as a composition of:

(1) A sensor (i.e. radar) which detects anything within the specified range,
(2) A filter (i.e. computing module) which looks up the database to see if the detected object is an enemy airplane, and
(3) A motor (i.e. the gun itself) which fires bullets at any object which is identified as an enemy airplane.

The gun detects an aircraft, checks to see if it is an enemy, shoots at it if so, and then detects another aircraft, checks to see if it is an enemy, shoots at it if so, and then detects another aircraft... and so on.

This is just a simple example. For more complex behaviors, you may as well equip it with multiple sensors (e.g. radar, camera, antenna), multiple filters (e.g. distance filter, look-angle filter), multiple motors (e.g. gun, horizontal rotor, vertical rotor, ammunition reloader), etc.

Such a multitude of modules can then communicate with one another by means of series connections, parallel connections, or both.

@@<h3><b>Physical Space and Conceptual Space</b></h3>

There are two different spaces in our universe - physical space and conceptual space.

Physical space is the space we usually refer to whenever we are employing the word "space". It consists of spatial and temporal axes (e.g. X, Y, Z, and Time), and serves as a frame of reference when it comes to describing physical entities such as rigid bodies.

Conceptual space, on the other hand, is the space of qualitative features. For example, a color is a position in the RGB color space, where the axes (R, G, B) represent the intensity levels of the three primary color components (i.e. Red, Green, Blue). The RGB color space is one of many types of conceptual spaces we can imagine.

Each object has its own position in physical space as well as a position in conceptual space. The former tells us where the object is, and the latter tells us what the object looks like.

[Mathematical Interpretation of Hume's Philosophy] July 2, 2024

This is a mathematical interpretation of David Hume's philosophy. It is mostly based upon my personal analysis, so please take it with a grain of salt.

I drew most of my inspirations from his book, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding". For more information, visit <a href="https://thingspool.net/read-rec/page-6.html">Here</a>.

@@<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

Hume's empiricist worldview begins with a hierarchy of concepts.

There are two major types of components in his domain of knowledge. One is "perceptions", and the other one is "objects of reason". Perceptions are the atoms of the mind, whereas objects of reason are molecules which can be formed by bonding those atoms together.

A perception is any "thought" we can conceive in our minds. It belongs to either one of the two categories - impressions and ideas.

An impression is a direct stimulus received by our sense organs. Things we directly see, hear, smell, taste, and feel are all impressions.

In contrast, an idea is an afterthought on the impressions we received. For example, what we see is an impression, but the recollection of what we just saw is an idea. Impressions are vivid, while ideas are dim.

Objects of reason can be subdivided into two categories - "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact".

A relation of ideas is a result of pure logic, such as a mathematical theorem which manages to prove itself based upon a set of ideas only, without relying on the presence of external stimuli. A matter of fact, on the other hand, requires a considerable amount of empirical data to validate itself (like the law of gravitation).
