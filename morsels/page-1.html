<h3><b>Mechanical Narratives</b></h3>
<p>A game is usually a combination of two factors - mechanics and narratives.</p>
<p>Mechanics represent the systematic aspects of the game, such as physics, AI, crafting rules, progression curves, and others which rely on the knowledge of math/engineering.</p>
<p>Narratives represent the volitional aspects of the game, such as lores, stories, personalities, goals, and others which rely on the knowledge of arts/humanities.</p>
<p>A problem we often experience is that it is too tricky to fit these two together in one place. Many ambiguous cases are prone to arise, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Having a cool story (narrative) for a video game, but not knowing how to turn it into gameplay (mechanic).<br>(2) Knowing how to implement a clever enemy AI (mechanic), but not knowing how to design an appropriate enemy character for it (narrative).<br>(3) Having an interesting NPC with a unique personality (narrative), but not knowing which in-game role it ought to play (mechanic).</p>
<p>A solution is to start designing the game with building blocks which can both be considered mechanics and narratives at the same time (aka "mechanical narratives").</p>
<p>If we start by laying out the game's narratives first, it will be difficult to devise mechanics which are compatible with the given narratives. If we start by laying out the game's mechanics first, on the other hand, it will be difficult to devise narratives which are compatible with the given mechanics.</p>
<p>Such a dilemma can be bypassed by simply collecting a number of "mechanical narratives" and assembling them together.</p>

<h3><b>Sensors, Filters, and Motors</b></h3>
<p>In general, a gameplay agent can be constructed by assembling 3 types of modules - sensors, filters, and motors.</p>
<p>Sensors collect data from the environment, filters process the data (for analysis), and motors trigger the agent to take actions based upon the filtered data.</p>
<p>Here is an example. Imagine that there is an anti-aircraft gun whose role is to shoot down enemy airplanes in range. We can model this gun as a composition of:</p>
<p>(1) A sensor (i.e. radar) which detects anything within the specified range,<br>(2) A filter (i.e. computing module) which looks up the database to see if the detected object is an enemy airplane, and<br>(3) A motor (i.e. the gun itself) which fires bullets at any object which is identified as an enemy airplane.</p>
<p>The gun detects an aircraft, checks to see if it is an enemy, shoots at it if so, and then detects another aircraft, checks to see if it is an enemy, shoots at it if so, and then detects another aircraft... and so on.</p>
<p>This is just a simple example. For more complex behaviors, you may as well equip it with multiple sensors (e.g. radar, camera, antenna), multiple filters (e.g. distance filter, look-angle filter), multiple motors (e.g. gun, horizontal rotor, vertical rotor, ammunition reloader), etc.</p>
<p>Such a multitude of modules can then communicate with one another by means of series connections, parallel connections, or both.</p>

<h3><b>Psychological Force Field</b></h3>
<p>Psychological force field is a useful concept in game design.</p>
<p>We typically imagine each individual game character as an observer, equipped with its own independent mind. It continuously scans the environment and makes decisions off of it.</p>
<p>Each observer carries its own psychological force field which permeates the entirety of the game world. Every entity other than the observer itself essentially "warps" the field nearby, modifying the magnitudes and directions of the force vectors which guide the observer's movement.</p>
<p>A repulsive entity adds outward forces to the field, whereas an attractive entity adds inward forces to the field. This makes the observer move away from repulsive entities and closer to attractive entities.</p>
<p>Whether an entity is repulsive or attractive is determined by the observer's personal preference.</p>
<p>The force that is to be applied to the observer can be computed by the function "PsyForce(id, X, Y)", where "id" is the unique ID of the observer and (X, Y) is the observer's current position. This function returns the psychological force vector which gets added to the observer's net force.</p>
<p>A real life example of psychological force field is Feng Shui, where architectural patterns are believed to shape the field in which the residents of the house reside, thereby influencing the way they behave.</p>

<h3><b>Parallel-Attention Timeline</b></h3>
<p>A parallel-attention timeline is a pretty useful tool to use in gameplay AI.</p>
<p>It starts from a simple analogy.</p>
<p>When I am stirring a pot of spaghetti while also heating a plate of frozen garlic bread in the oven, you can say that I must be multitasking.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that I am paying way more attention to the pot of spaghetti than to the oven because the latter basically takes care of itself and only demands occasional supervision.</p>
<p>When designing a game, it is convenient to assume that each game character carries its own schedule in its mind, filled with tasks which start and end at their own designated points in time.</p>
<p>It is sometimes even more desirable, though, to model a schedule not as a one-dimensional queue of tasks, but as a two-dimensional grid in which each column represents a time slot and each row represents what could be referred to as "attention priority".</p>
<p>A character which follows this two-dimensional schedule always runs the task which occupies the highest row (i.e. highest attention priority) among all the tasks which occupy the current time slot.</p>
<p>Whenever an "attention trigger" (i.e. any object which demands attention) tries to register a new task to the schedule, the schedule will either ignore this new task if it happens to collide with an existing one, or proceed to register it if not.</p>
<p>Each task possesses its own intrinsic attention priority (i.e. row) which cannot be modified.</p>

<h3><b>Partial Movement Constraints</b></h3>
<p>Both too much freedom and too little freedom are undesirable in gameplay.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are enemy characters whom the player must defeat in order to finish the level.</p>
<p>If the enemies are able to move in any direction, it will be a bit too bland because it reduces the functional significance of the level's peculiar spatial configuration (e.g. If you are being chased by an enemy who can only move horizontally, you can take refuge in a vertical space).</p>
<p>If the enemies are completely immobile, on the other hand, it will be pretty bland as well because it makes gameplay less dynamic.</p>
<p>A nice middle ground which leverages the benefits of both is to confine each enemy's locomotive freedom to a set of simple pathways, as though it is a train following a railway.</p>
<p>This mixed approach has 3 main advantages:</p>
<p>(1) It makes it easy to diversify enemy behaviors and introduce a wide variety of in-game strategies.<br>(2) Its pathfinding algorithm is easier to implement and way less computationally expensive than, say, the A-Star algorithm.<br>(3) It prevents extreme gameplay scenarios, such as letting the player be completely surrounded by a truckload of enemies because they always keep chasing the player without a pause. By limiting each enemy's maximum range of movement, we can spread out the distribution of enemies throughout the level and prevent them from concentrating too much in one place.</p>
