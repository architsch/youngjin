<p>This is a mathematical interpretation of David Hume's philosophy. It is mostly based upon my personal analysis, so please take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I drew most of my inspirations from his book, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding". For more information, visit <a href="https://thingspool.net/read-rec/page-6.html">Here</a>.</p>

<h3><b>1. Introduction</b></h3>
<p>Hume's empiricist worldview begins with a hierarchy of concepts.</p>
<p>There are two major types of components in his domain of knowledge. One is "perceptions", and the other one is "objects of reason". Perceptions are the atoms of the mind, whereas objects of reason are molecules which can be formed by bonding those atoms together.</p>
<p>A perception is any "thought" we can conceive in our minds. It belongs to either one of the two categories - impressions and ideas.</p>
<p>An impression is a direct stimulus received by our sense organs. Things we directly see, hear, smell, taste, and feel are all impressions.</p>
<p>In contrast, an idea is an afterthought on the impressions we received. For example, what we see is an impression, but the recollection of what we just saw is an idea. Impressions are vivid, while ideas are dim.</p>
<p>Objects of reason can be subdivided into two categories - "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact".</p>
<p>A relation of ideas is a result of pure logic, such as a mathematical theorem which manages to prove itself based upon a set of ideas only, without relying on the presence of external stimuli. A matter of fact, on the other hand, requires a considerable amount of empirical data to validate itself (like the law of gravitation).</p>

<h3><b>2. Impressions and Ideas</b></h3>
<p>Hume's definition of "impressions" and "ideas" provides us with a rudimentary ground of logic, upon which we can formulate a model of how we sense and recall our own thoughts.</p>
<p>Impressions are what we typically refer to as "sensory stimuli". These are the most immediate and piercing kind of perceptions which we feel with the utmost degree of intensity.</p>
<p>Ideas, on the other hand, are byproducts of impressions. They linger in our minds like ghosts, which occasionally touch our feelings but to a much lesser degree. Unlike impressions which are momentary, ideas stay in the person's memory and get recalled on demand.</p>
<p>In a way, therefore, ideas are Lego bricks which can fit one another nicely in our minds, whereas impressions are just raw plastic ingredients which are yet to be molded into such bricks.</p>

<h3><b>3. Generation of Ideas</b></h3>
<p>According to Hume's philosophy, each impression generates its corresponding idea when it enters our domain of cognition.</p>
<p>However, he also mentions that the relation between impressions and their ideas is not necessarily one-to-one. There may as well be cases in which a wide spectrum of ideas manage to emerge from a relatively few impressions.</p>
<p>An impression of "light blue" and an impression of "dark blue", for example, may allow us to imagine an intermediate shade of blue (by mixing the qualities of light blue and dark blue) and remember it as a distinct idea. This lets us picture the full spectrum of blue without having to directly sense every single one of its variants via external stimuli.</p>

<h3><b>4. Relations between Ideas</b></h3>
<p>We assign meaning to our ideas by establishing relations between them. In Hume's model of the human mind, there are three fundamental types of such relations - resemblance, contiguity, and causality (aka "cause and effect").</p>
<p>Resemblance tells us that two ideas are qualitatively similar to each other (such as two slightly different shades of blue). This is something we can immediately tell from our perceptions.</p>
<p>Contiguity tells us how close two ideas are to each other in spacetime. This, too, is something we can immediately tell from our perceptions.</p>
<p>Causality, however, is not something we can identify in such a straightforward manner. We must derive it from the other two types of relations (i.e. resemblance and contiguity).</p>

<img class="figureImage" src="https://thingspool.net/morsels/015.jpg" alt="Mathematical Interpretation of Hume's Philosophy (Figure 5)">
<h3><b>5. Causal Relations</b></h3>
<p>An idea alone does not have the word "cause" or "effect" written on its face, and the only way for us to prove that an idea "causes" another idea is that one of them frequently precedes (or succeeds) the other in spacetime.</p>
<p>Also, since it is almost impossible for us to reproduce the same exact idea over and over in our material world (which is plagued with all sorts of random noises such as acoustic waves, electromagnetic disturbances, thermal noise, etc), we must rely on our belief that similar causes are likely to produce similar effects.</p>
<p>This leads us to the conclusion that, if a set of mutually resembling ideas are contiguous with another set of mutually resembling ideas, we can say that these two sets are causally related to each other.</p>

<h3><b>6. Facts</b></h3>
<p>What is a "fact", really?</p>
<p>There are many ideas in our domain of reason, yet the boundary between ones that are supposed to be "facts" and ones that are mere personal feelings often looks a bit fuzzy.</p>
<p>Hume's philosophy tells us that an idea can be considered a "fact" if it is caused by a sufficiently large number of causes (e.g. preceded by a sufficiently long chain of causal relations).</p>
<p>Each cause works as a proof of the idea's truthfulness. The more causes there are, the more confidently we are able to say that the idea is true. If it is so true that its truthfulness is hardly questionable, we say that the idea is a "fact".</p>
<p>People who know how a blockchain works (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) will easily come to the realization that ideas are reminiscent of blockchain transactions, and that a "fact" is basically a transaction which has been mined (verified) and is given credit by a long chain of preceding blocks.</p>

<h3><b>7. Simple and Complex Ideas</b></h3>
<p>In "A Treatise of Human Nature", Hume makes a clear distinction between simple and complex ideas.</p>
<p>Based upon his rejection of the infinite divisibility of our sense-data, he says that "simple ideas" are ideas which cannot be further divided into its component parts, meaning that they are the "atoms" of our mind.</p>
<p>Examples of simple ideas include the primary color components (e.g. red, green, and blue), musical notes, and other irreducible units of sensation.</p>
<p>"Complex ideas", on the other hand, are groups of simple ideas. Each complex idea is a product of synthesis among two or more simple ideas. It is also possible to group complex ideas to form even more complex ideas.</p>
<p>A simple impression (i.e. external stimulus) gives birth to a simple idea. A multitude of simple ideas, then, give birth to complex ideas based on the way in which they are related to each other.</p>
<hr>
<div class="l_spacer"></div>
<img class="figureImage" src="https://thingspool.net/morsels/028.jpg" alt="Mathematical Interpretation of Hume's Philosophy (Figure 8)">
<h3><b>8. Abstraction and Combination</b></h3>
<p>A group of simple ideas are able to produce a complex idea. A group of complex ideas, too, are able to produce yet another complex idea which is even more complex than the preceding ones.</p>
<p>In general, therefore, we can say that a group of ideas with appropriate relations, whether they are simple or complex, are capable of generating a complex idea whose level of complexity is slightly higher than them.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which a complex idea may emerge - abstraction and combination.</p>
<p>When you see a group of slightly different shades of blue, you will recognize that they closely resemble each other. From this, you can conclude that they all belong to a class of objects called "blue". This is an example of abstraction.</p>
<p>When you see a lump of various colors, on the other hand, you will recognize that the individual colored spots do not necessarily resemble each other but are nevertheless very closely packed together in physical space. From this, you can conclude that they all belong to the same object. This is an example of combination.</p>

<h3><b>9. Relations between Complex Ideas</b></h3>
<p>There are two primary types of relations between ideas - resemblance and contiguity. Resemblance indicates conceptual proximity, and contiguity indicates physical proximity.</p>
<p>Just like resemblance and contiguity can connect simple ideas, they are able to connect complex ideas as well.</p>
<p>An object is a complex idea which is based off of a set of contiguous ideas. When two objects have sufficiently many pairs of resembling ideas between them, they resemble each other.</p>
<p>A class is a complex idea which is based off of a set of resembling ideas. When two classes have sufficiently many pairs of contiguous ideas between them, they are contiguous to each other.</p>
<p>A contiguity between two classes may also be referred to as "causality" (i.e. One of them is either the "cause" or "effect" of the other).</p>

<div class="l_spacer"></div>
<img class="figureImage" src="https://thingspool.net/morsels/030.jpg" alt="Mathematical Interpretation of Hume's Philosophy (Figure 10)">
<h3><b>10. Data Structure of an Idea</b></h3>
<p>According to Hume's argument in "A Treatise of Human Nature", every idea (or impression) must possess its own quality and quantity.</p>
<p>An idea's quality denotes the category of sensation to which it belongs, such as "brightness", "musical pitch", or "temperature".</p>
<p>An idea's quantity denotes its quality's intensity level. For instance, if there is an idea whose quality is "temperature" and whose quantity is "30", we may consider this idea as a sensation of warmth which is 30 degrees in temperature.</p>
<p>Hume says that an impression is basically the same thing as an idea (i.e. It has its own quality and quantity), except that it is much higher in "force and vivacity".</p>
<p>Therefore, I personally find that it is much more convenient to consider an impression as an idea whose level of vivacity is sufficiently high.</p>
<p>When expressed in the language of computer science, both impressions and ideas are mere instances of the same data structure called "Idea", which contains 3 integers - Quality, Quantity, and Vivacity.</p>

<img class="figureImage" src="https://thingspool.net/morsels/031.jpg" alt="Mathematical Interpretation of Hume's Philosophy (Figure 11)">
<h3><b>11. Metaphor</b></h3>
<p>Metaphors are everywhere. They appear in poetry, novels, songs, and many other forms of media. However, they are often accused of being irrational.</p>
<p>Hume's philosophy suggests otherwise. It is possible to define a metaphor on a rational basis.</p>
<p>An idea has a location in conceptual space, which is composed of two dimensions called "quality" and "quantity". Quality indicates the category of sensation (e.g. brightness, loudness, temperature, etc), and quantity indicates its level of intensity.</p>
<p>We say that there is a resemblance between two ideas when they are close to each other in conceptual space. There are two types of resemblances: (1) Resemblance in quality, and (2) Resemblance in quantity.</p>
<p>Coldness and hotness do not resemble each other quantitatively, since their intensity levels (i.e. temperature) differ significantly. However, they resemble each other qualitatively because they both belong to the same category called "temperature".</p>
<p>On the contrary, red and hotness do not resemble each other qualitatively because they belong to two drastically different categories of sensation. However, they resemble each other quantitatively because the high emotional intensity of red is similar in magnitude to the high temperature of hotness. This is what we call "a metaphor".</p>
