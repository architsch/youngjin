<p>This is a mathematical interpretation of David Hume's philosophy. It is mostly based upon my personal analysis, so please take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I drew most of my inspirations from his book, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding". For more information, visit <a href="https://thingspool.net/read-rec/page-6.html">Here</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>Hume's empiricist worldview begins with a hierarchy of concepts.</p>
<p>There are two major types of components in his domain of knowledge. One is "perceptions", and the other one is "objects of reason". Perceptions are the atoms of the mind, whereas objects of reason are molecules which can be formed by bonding those atoms together.</p>
<p>A perception is any "thought" we can conceive in our minds. It belongs to either one of the two categories - impressions and ideas.</p>
<p>An impression is a direct stimulus received by our sense organs. Things we directly see, hear, smell, taste, and feel are all impressions.</p>
<p>In contrast, an idea is an afterthought on the impressions we received. For example, what we see is an impression, but the recollection of what we just saw is an idea. Impressions are vivid, while ideas are dim.</p>
<p>Objects of reason can be subdivided into two categories - "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact".</p>
<p>A relation of ideas is a result of pure logic, such as a mathematical theorem which manages to prove itself based upon a set of ideas only, without relying on the presence of external stimuli. A matter of fact, on the other hand, requires a considerable amount of empirical data to validate itself (like the law of gravitation).</p>

<h3><b>Impressions and Ideas</b></h3>
<p>Hume's definition of "impressions" and "ideas" provides us with a rudimentary ground of logic, upon which we can formulate a model of how we sense and recall our own thoughts.</p>
<p>Impressions are what we typically refer to as "sensory stimuli". These are the most immediate and piercing kind of perceptions which we feel with the utmost degree of intensity.</p>
<p>Ideas, on the other hand, are byproducts of impressions. They linger in our minds like ghosts, which occasionally touch our feelings but to a much lesser degree. Unlike impressions which are momentary, ideas stay in the person's memory and get recalled on demand.</p>
<p>In a way, therefore, ideas are Lego bricks which can fit one another nicely in our minds, whereas impressions are just raw plastic ingredients which are yet to be molded into such bricks.</p>

<h3><b>Generation of Ideas</b></h3>
<p>According to Hume's philosophy, each impression generates its corresponding idea when it enters our domain of cognition.</p>
<p>However, he also mentions that the relation between impressions and their ideas is not necessarily one-to-one. There may as well be cases in which a wide spectrum of ideas manage to emerge from a relatively few impressions.</p>
<p>An impression of "light blue" and an impression of "dark blue", for example, may allow us to imagine an intermediate shade of blue (by mixing the qualities of light blue and dark blue) and remember it as a distinct idea. This lets us picture the full spectrum of blue without having to directly sense every single one of its variants via external stimuli.</p>

<h3><b>Relations between Ideas</b></h3>
<p>We assign meaning to our ideas by establishing relations between them. In Hume's model of the human mind, there are three fundamental types of such relations - resemblance, contiguity, and causality (aka "cause and effect").</p>
<p>Resemblance tells us that two ideas are qualitatively similar to each other (such as two slightly different shades of blue). This is something we can immediately tell from our perceptions.</p>
<p>Contiguity tells us how close two ideas are to each other in spacetime. This, too, is something we can immediately tell from our perceptions.</p>
<p>Causality, however, is not something we can identify in such a straightforward manner. We must derive it from the other two types of relations (i.e. resemblance and contiguity).</p>
