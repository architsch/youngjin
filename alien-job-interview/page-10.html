<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Airl's Real Identity</p>
<p>(PERSONAL NOTE)</p>
<p>Everyone in the interview room was shocked to hear Airl's confession. Apparently, applying for a job was not even his primary goal. He was just living in California as an undercover code monkey, while secretly devising his plan to destroy planet Earth.</p>
<p>"So, this is your true identity! I knew it, I knew it the moment I saw you had balls to bring your flying saucer to my office building and occupied 5 parking spots at once without paying extra fees!" said the CEO.</p>
<p>"Oh, you humans are too quick to notice," said Airl. He opened up his jacket and revealed his waist belt, which was made up of a chain of coke and mentos bottles arranged in an alternating pattern.</p>
<p>"You ruined my plan. All I needed was to get an admin access to Boeing's GitHub repository to screw all your skyscrapers, after visiting the White House to publicly announce my will to annihilate your civilization," said the alien. Without hesitation, he pulled a colorful laser pistol out of his pocket and pressed one of its buttons. A series of crazy sound effects began to play, while the tip was emitting beams of rainbow.</p>
<p>"Kill him!" cried the CEO. A security officer pointed a Glock at Airl and fed his chest a couple of cone-shaped metal pieces, which the alien didn't seem to appreciate.</p>
<p>Airl suddenly grabbed my company laptop, made a couple of gymnastic movements to escape the interview room, and began to run towards his flying saucer which was parked right outside of the office. Another officer who was waiting in the parking lot saw him and pulled the plug out of the saucer's fuel tank to drain oil from it.</p>
<p>"Nice try, but mine is a hybrid model," chuckled Airl, leaping onto the top of the saucer.</p>
<p>"Quick! The alien is trying to steal our confidential tax info!" exclaimed the accountant, but it was too late. The alien's flying saucer already took off and swiftly zoomed through the air.</p>
<p>A split second later, a loud buzzing sound struck everyone's eardrums like a thunder. Electric poles near the parking lot tumbled over the grass whilst emitting brief sparks of high voltage. The flying saucer lost its velocity, crashed onto the ground, and burned. Apparently it crossed the power lines and was electrocuted.</p>
