<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Domain</p>
<p>(PERSONAL NOTE)</p>
<p>Airl told me his reasons for contacting my company in the first place. He was sent by the Domain's accountant to see if he could get a job somewhere else, so as to let them get rid of one of their major budget sinks. Their office was located inside their CEO's mom's basement, in which they wrote a whitepaper explaining why they have a cutting-edge IT solution destined to fix every customer's first world problems. Their paper contains flat clipart images of dancing 2D business people, so it must be authentic.</p>
<p>Airl also told me that each member of their studio, the Domain, is called an "IS-BE" (short for "Introverted and Sensitive BEing"). Unlike humans like myself who need daily 3-hour meetings for any meaningful execution of business, IS-BEs are capable of somehow collaborating with one another without any explicit communication, other than occasional passive-aggressive remarks exchanged through Slack. This technically makes them telepathic beings.</p>
<p>At first I could not trust the authenticity of his career, since the Domain was not even registered as a business by any legal means. Sensing my doubt, this alien pulled up his phone and began to scroll through his Instagram posts (This further enhanced my conviction that he really belonged to those Millennial subspecies). And suddenly he pointed his finger at my phone and said, "Be my follower!"</p>
<p>Immediately, I realized that my phone's Instagram account became a follower of his, and my phone began to display pages after pages of Airl's personal posts! I was able to see the photos of him working with his triple-monitor desktop in his San Francisco apartment, eating a bucket of avocado salad in San Jose, and coding on his laptop while commuting to Mountain View.</p>
<p>I will never forget this striking moment of discovery. Apparently he lived in California, which means he must be up to something big in the tech industry! It also cleared up the question of whether he really had more than 10 years of professional experience in front-end web development.</p>
