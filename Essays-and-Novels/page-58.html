<p>What is an idea?</p>
<p>We live in a world which consists of two distinct domains; one belongs to the realm of physical beings (i.e. Things we can see, touch, smell, and taste), and the other one which belongs to the realm of pure, abstract ideas. An apple belongs to the domain of physics, yet the idea of an apple belongs to the domain of ideas.</p>
<p>Just as a universe of physical phenomena can be modeled as a physical space which consists of spatial dimensions such as X, Y, and Z, a universe of our mental conceptions can be modeled as an "idea space" in which every single point in its coordinate system can be thought of as the most indivisible, "atomic" idea our minds can ever conceive.</p>
<p>Such atomic ideas serve as building blocks of more complex ideas. They establish connections with one another which represent their mutual relations. For example, the algebraic expression "A=B" is a molecule that is made out of 3 atomic ideas which are indicated by symbols "A", "=", and "B", respectively. "=" has two sockets to which other atoms can bond, since it is a binary operator which requires the availability of two input values in order to produce an output value (i.e. which is either TRUE or FALSE). "A" and "B" have their own sockets as well, both referring to their respective values. The result is that the (meta)physical laws of our idea space allow these 3 atoms to bond together in a form that is reminiscent of a water molecule (H2O).</p>
