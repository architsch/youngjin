<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Airl's Disclosure</p>
<p>(PERSONAL NOTE)</p>
<p>During my lessons, some of the IT executives interfered several times to ask Airl a bunch of questions regarding his willingness to accept whichever pay range they offer, work overtime without compensation, and show other marks of loyalty to prove that it makes sense for us to hire this alien instead of just outsourcing those of his kind in India. Airl refused to answer them, which suggested that he belonged to one of those notorious subspecies of the engineering race called "The Millennials".</p>
<p>After going through 20 or more short lessons on how to behave like an adult who has family and life, Airl suddenly stopped me and said, "I am ready to speak now". Thus our new interview began.</p>
<p>(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)</p>
<p>Me: "What would you like to say, Airl?"</p>
<p>Airl: "I have been part of the Domain's Expeditionary Development Team for the last several years. Before I became part of the Domain, I worked as a junior programmer in the Old Empire. I have not personally had intimate contact with "social" beings like you throughout my whole career. It is not my primary function to interact with people who do not talk in 1s and 0s. I am a digital nomad, inventor, and engineer, with many duties to perform. Although I am fluent in 347 programming languages practiced by the Domain, I have not been exposed to your esoteric language called "Plain English".</p>
<p>"Shortly after I left the Old Empire, I was trained and served as a researcher, data analyst, and software development officer for the Domain. We were an independent group of ambitious developers with the goal of replacing the reign of the Old Empire and their toxic work environment."</p>
<p>Me: "... Okay. Will you answer questions from the IT executives now?"</p>
<p>Airl: "No, I will not answer questions. I will provide information to you that will show you why I am totally not desperate to get a job now, and that you will probably miss out someone irreplaceable if you do not offer me a 7 figure salary".</p>
