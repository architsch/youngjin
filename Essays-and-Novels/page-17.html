<p>Alien Job Interview</p>
<p>Chapter 9: A Special Treatment</p>
<p>(PERSONAL NOTE)</p>
<p>After listening to Airl's stupidly long rant, I began to believe that this alien may belong to one of those "Boomer" subspecies of the engineering race instead of the Millennials. His tendency to go on forever talking about his own "wisdom" gained from his boring old days annoyed the hell out of me. Since I was a professional recruiter, however, I made sure to keep smiling during the whole interview session whilst displaying a series of passive-aggressive gestures to let him realize that I don't care about his story at all.</p>
<p>Shortly after the first half of the interview, I submitted my transcript to the IT executives. They read it and were deeply annoyed by the fact that this alien even dared to express his own opinion. They immediately reported this act of offense to the CEO, who responded by saying that he will take control of the rest of the interview.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the CEO entered the interview room and sat in front of Airl.</p>
<p>(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)</p>
<p>CEO: "In case you don't know yet, our team is a group of open-minded innovators who think outside the box and are not afraid of questioning things. We value creativity and imagination, and encourage every individual to speak up, challenge the norm, and create impacts on our journey to make this world a better place. In order to see if you are a good fit, let me ask you one question. What is the most creative color?"</p>
<p>Airl: "Green."</p>
<p>CEO: "You are probably thinking that way because schools in your home planet taught you so. An open-minded, innovative individual would've said something that sounds more creative, like "magenta". But anyways, I will give you another chance to prove yourself that you are an active thinker and not the type of coder who sits on his desk all day long, only doing what he's told to do. Are you working on any open-source projects?"</p>
<p>Airl: "I do work on a project, although it is not open-source."</p>
<p>CEO: "Can you describe it to me?"</p>
<p>Airl: "It is a plan to destroy your planet."</p>
<p>CEO: "Ha, I got you!"</p>
