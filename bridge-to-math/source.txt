[A Layman's Bridge to Mathematics - Preface] May 15, 2024

Math is an important subject. We learn it in order to have a better understanding of the world around us. It is also useful for various applications such as those pertaining to economics, natural sciences, engineering, and many others.

The process of learning math, however, is oftentimes a bit of a pain in one's anatomical bottom. And the main reason why this is so is that the way in which math is being presented to the public is dominated by an enormous heap of dry rules and nitpicky technical details. To be fair, what sort of crackpot would be delighted to spend one's nightly leisure time watching a silent interplay of numbers, points, lines, and Greek letters on a sheet of paper?

A book which deals with mathematical ideas is typically filled up with a truckload of abstract symbols, as well as numerous theorems, examples, and proofs which thoroughly dissect their meanings. Such a comprehensive method of breaking down what is meant to be conveyed to the reader is, without a doubt, the most sincere and effective means of organizing a mathematical treatise.

Such a thorough manner of presentation, though, usually baffles those who are not professional mathematicians and thus do not possess enough patience to follow all the tasteless details. To the reader who is already endowed with the holy spirit of mathematics, those esoteric Greek letters do imply something enjoyable. To the layman, they do not mean anything.

Sadly, many of us often feel the necessity to spend some time studying mathematics for the sake of staying competent in our modern world, which is being governed by economists, business professionals, scientists, and engineers whose expertise heavily depends on the understanding of math. And this tendency seems to amplify itself the more our technology advances.

The problem lies on the fact that, while we do need to learn math, most of its study materials are so painfully unapproachable. And I myself wholeheartedly share this sentiment as well, even though I am an engineer with a 4-year university degree in engineering; it often requires me to load my brain with at least 100mg of caffeine in order to fool it into thinking that an algebraic formula is something interesting to look at.

So, how to fix this horrendous discrepancy between the necessity to learn math and the sheer lack of motivation to do so?

There indeed have been many attempts to deal with this problem, especially among educators, which involved storytelling (as in "Algebra, the Easy Way" by Douglas Downing), interactive visuals, games, and other fascinating experiments in the domain of mixed media.

Yet, for some reason, they do not seem as mainstream as they should be. Core math curriculums in the majority of public schools still heavily focus on teaching a set of formal proofs and problem-solving methodologies, most of which are obsessed rather too much with the technical side of mathematical reasoning than the divine inspiration behind it. As a result, most students get tired of the perennial influx of details before they grasp a chance to find passion in the subject.

In order to alleviate this shared sense of frustration, some educators choose to motivate their students by trying to convince them how useful math is. They tell their students that cool inventions such as airplanes, gaming PCs, Ferris wheels, and ice-pooping refrigerators are all being made by smart people who know all the fancy math and stuff, and that we, too, can do similar cool things by memorizing a bunch of theorems and knowing how to apply them.

Such a type of motivation, however, inadvertently degrades mathematics into some kind of "necessary evil" - a bucket of unappetizing veggies you must force yourself to swallow for the purpose of achieving some distant goal. This confounding gap between the ends and means is what often separates us from the pure joy of thinking mathematically; it is just not as directly rewarding as, say, playing video games.

Many (if not most) of the dedicated mathematicians who study math "just for fun" are not the ones who study it for the sake of utilizing it as a means of something else. They enjoy math as it is, just like many artists take pride in creating art for art's sake and nothing else. It is a "thing in itself", an inexplicable yet quantifiable sort of ghost which is everywhere but is never directly visible.

How to let ourselves grasp such a profound breed of enjoyment without too much hassle, then? A straightforward answer is to keep exposing ourselves to the world of mathematics as much as possible until a tickling moment of enlightenment reveals itself before the face of our subconscious, by means of reading textbooks, solving math problems, following lectures, and so on. This, however, requires us to spend too much time and energy to stay in focus. There must be a better way.

Let us start from common sense. The number one reason why mathematics is uninteresting to most of us is that it looks so detached from our everyday life. Most of us just do not "see" math in things we experience daily, although it really is everywhere from an abstract point of view (In a way, it is the highest form of philosophy - the purest essence of what we can think of and reason with). This is because math is abstract by nature; we can only induce its presence from the collective sum of our experiences.

<001>

The key is to narrow down the gap between our senses and their underlying abstract implications. And since we can only elaborate our own thoughts in terms of what we can directly perceive (because even purely abstract ideas require us to use symbols to express them), we must start with experiences which are familiar to us and then figure out how to let them reveal their own gateways to the beauty of mathematics.

[A Layman's Bridge to Mathematics - Part 1] May 18, 2024

First of all, let me suggest that food is our common denominator of interest. There are people who are not interested in sports, religions, politics, and the like, but there is absolutely no one who is not interested in eating at all (If there is one, that dude is dead).

And guess what? Since we like food, we must seek ways of obtaining it. Let's consider a biscuit as an example. One of the most obvious ways of acquiring a biscuit is to bake a piece of dough.

biscuit = bake(dough)

<002>

But in order to do that, we must first have a piece of dough in our hands. Let's make one, then, by mixing flour with water.

dough = mix(flour, water)

<003>

We can obtain flour by grinding wheat.

flour = grind(wheat)

<004>

To summarize, we can generate a biscuit by mixing ground wheat with water and baking it.

biscuit = bake(mix(grind(wheat), water))

<005>

I will explain the notations shown so far. "bake" is a function which takes dough as the input and produces a biscuit as the output, and "mix" is a function which takes flour and water as the input and produces dough as the output. "grind" is a function which takes wheat as the input as produces flour as the output. If you assemble these functions together in the right way, you will get a biscuit.

What is a "function", then? There are many ways of defining it, yet perhaps the most intuitive way is to consider a function as a little machine which has its own entrance and an exit. Through the entrance (aka "input port") it receives the ingredient, and through the exit (aka "output port") it spits out the result of manipulating the ingredient.

<006>

Whenever you choose to gather a multitude of such machines and compose them in order to produce the result you desire, you are building a factory where the individual workers collaborate with one another in a streamlined manner. The output of one worker could be handed over to another worker as the input, or multiple workers could be grabbing the same input and working on it concurrently so as to double the speed of production, and so on. There are so many possibilities here, and they can all be realized by joining functions with each other in creative ways. It all boils down to a network of input-output relations.

There is yet another way of defining what a function is, though. If you contemplate upon the meaning of a function in terms of what it does, you will soon come to the conclusion that a function is, on a purely conceptual level, just a bunch of connections between all of its possible inputs and their corresponding outputs.

<007>

Each connection (represented by an arrow) tells us which input values translate into which output values. For instance, the "bake" function can be identified as a set of connections between raw materials and their baked results.

<008>

What about a function which takes a pair of ingredients as the input instead of just a single ingredient? The "mix" function is a typical example of this; it "mixes" the two given ingredients and produces a mixture between the two as the output. In this case, we can consider each connection as one which maps a pair of input elements (instead of just a singular input) into their corresponding output.

<009>

This kind of representation is fine, for the purpose of providing us with a means of understanding what a function does. There is something quite annoying in this approach, however. As you may have noticed already, it is way too cumbersome to describe a function by mentioning every one of its input-output relations. For a very simple function it might be manageable, but for a fairly complex function it is prohibitively laborious.

What do we do, then? If taking all possible input-output relations into account proves itself to be too difficult, the other solution we ought to follow is to specify the general pattern in which inputs are being associated with their respective outputs. And in order to do that, we must establish a way to somehow "align" all the inputs (as well as outputs) in the form of an ordered sequence. This will give them a structure to fit in, thereby enabling us to render their behavior in terms of a generally applicable rule rather than an enormous collection of case-by-case scenarios.

<010>

Here, we are grouping all the possible inputs as an ordered sequence (represented by a long vertical arrow). Also, we are grouping all the possible outputs as yet another ordered sequence. The reason why we are doing this is to keep things organized.

As we ponder upon the very nature of what the so-called "inputs" and "outputs" really are, we quickly come to the realization that there is not really an intrinsic difference between things that are labeled as "inputs" and things that are labeled as "outputs"; an output of a function can also be an input of another function, and vice versa. Inputs and outputs are both "things" which, in the most unbiased mode of representation, can best be depicted as a set of points in empty space.

<011>

Oh, but here is where the trouble comes! Since there are so many things in our world to keep track of, we cannot just randomly plot them on a gigantic sheet of paper and try to make sense of them; such an undisciplined approach will make everything extremely confusing. What do we do, then? For sanity's sake, we organize them in some way or another. And one the most straightforward ways of organizing a bunch of things is to group them into categories.

<012>

For example, a variety of sandwiches, such as "chicken sandwich", "tuna sandwich", "meatball sandwich", "BLT sandwich", "PB&J sandwich", and the like, can all be grouped into the same category called "sandwich". The same logic applies to different breeds of a biological specie, different chemical elements in the periodic table, and so forth.

This sort of classification is still not enough, though. A category may turn out to be too broad in scope, that there are still way too many unorganized things lurking inside each category. This impels us to keep introducing new categories within our existing categories, thus giving birth to a taxonomical hierarchy.

<013>

As we do this, however, we begin to complicate things rather too much. It is usually not so high a virtue to have Russian dolls in one's faculty of reasoning, and it is important for one to admit that a more sustainable method of keeping things under control is to order them in the form of a sequence.

<014>

The long arrow shown here is a sequence, which bears a direction as well as the sense of alignment. Elements of this sequence either come before or after one another, depending on which of them are closer to the head of the arrow than others, etc. And the most quintessential advantage of doing it this way is that it lets us refer to things with numbers instead of arbitrary names.

<015>

Numbers reflect the concept of order very accurately. 1 comes after 0, 2 comes after 1, and 3 comes after 2. By comparing numerical values, we can immediately tell ourselves whether a thing comes before or after another thing. And as we figure out the order of things, we acquire a key to unlock the secret of parallelism. Here is an example:

<016>

We are looking at a function which is characterized by the equation: "output = input + 1". It means that the output of this function is always the result of incrementing the input by 1. We do not have to list all possible inputs and their corresponding outputs to fully define what the function does, since the equation alone reveals all the clues we need to derive the output from any given input.

The reason why such an abbreviation is feasible is that this function only deals with numerical entities (i.e. things which make up a sequence when they are put together). Since the input is a string of ordered things and the output is also a string of ordered things, we can consider the function as some kind of "string manipulator" - a special gadget which absorbs a string, distorts it (using mechanical instructions such as: "Cut it!", "Stretch it!", "Shrink it!", etc), and emits the result.

If the input were a mere assortment of random objects (like a bottle of jelly beans), it would have been extremely difficult to figure out what to do with them exactly. As we tie them up on a rope and treat the whole body as a single entity, we begin to let ourselves move all these individual pieces at once by simply pulling the rope. In mathematics, such a rope is called a "number line".

Aside from the ease of operation, the aforementioned mode of thinking also lets us plot the function's input-output relations in the form of a graph, like the one shown below:

<017>

Such is the power of expressing things in terms of numbers, hence the reason why they are so commonly used in mathematics. But of course, numbers themselves do not mean anything unless we specify the context in which they are being used. If I just say "Three!", it will hardly mean anything. If I say that I have three eggs, on the other hand, it will definitely mean something which can be pictured in the listener's mind.
