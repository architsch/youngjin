## What is ThingsPool?

ThingsPool is a shared virtual space made up of interconnected **Rooms**. Each Room is a fully interactive 3D environment where you can:

- **Explore** — Travel across rooms and discover what others have built
- **Build** — Shape the world block by block using the voxel building system
- **Chat** — Meet and talk with other players in real time
- **Create** — Design your own rooms and turn them into anything you imagine

## For Artists and Creators

ThingsPool doubles as a creative platform. Build your own virtual gallery, design an interactive installation, or craft an entire world that tells a story. Every room can either be a blank canvas waiting to be shaped into something unique, or a hidden place of adventure inviting to be explored.

## For Developers

ThingsPool is open source and built with a modern real-time web stack — Three.js for 3D rendering, Socket.IO for multiplayer networking, and a custom physics and voxel engine for world building. If you're building your own multiplayer game, metaverse, or interactive web app, feel free to explore the codebase.
